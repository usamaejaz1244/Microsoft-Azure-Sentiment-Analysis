After 2 minutes of standing there, I called ""Hello?"" audibly into the kitchen and still was not acknowledged.  I finally stood at the hostess station and called the restaurant from my cell phone in an attempt to be acknowledged.  The phone rang loudly into the restaurant for another 3-4 minutes with no acknowledgement.  I finally walked around the restaurant trying to find staff to acknowledge me and found a waitress.  She did not apologize for me not being acknowledged, but told me there was a problem with the gas in the restaurant and they could not prepare and serve food in a timely manner.

This can only help them because there were people that did not even know that there was a B&N on the other side of the bridge and shopped here all the time.  Bad news for the little shops over on the other side, though.  However, if the River's Edge development is any indication, the right mix of national and local tenants, along with a pricy facelift, will bring back the old B&N strip.

Now to the new B&N!  It's clean, bright and organized.  It's also very roomy.  Not overcrowded like some bookstores are.  Maybe because they don't have much of a music selection (at least I did not see one) and that helped bring about space.  One thing that WILL keep them in business is the brilliant kids section.  It takes up the back third of the store!  It is so vibrant with colors and layout that it will definitely help kids start or continue their love of reading... and lead to future adult customers, who will be most likely buying their Nooks from here.

Just like many other BN stores, it sells overpriced books (few sales and few coupons) and CDs/DVDs. You can also pay the overpriced BN member rewards card ($25 a year) with little benefits ( -- 10% extra discount for members and some coupons sent via e-mail).  The store has a coffee shop that serves Starbucks coffee, pastries and sandwiches. Nice coffee shop. Great sugar cookies!!! Yum.

Here are my issues with this particular store:  

1) The space is limited and crowded. It has very limited seating in the books area. You have to bring the books to the coffee shop area if you need to read. I usually go there when I have specific things I'd like to buy, check their website first if they have the items ""in-stock"" and leave when I am done.

2) The children section is not great either, small area, no place to sit, too many dolls, toys and knick knacks that distract the children from getting the books.

3)  Cold staff - except for few people who work in the Children area, I have never had any one who is friendly. They need to smile... 

Despite all of the negatives, I think this particular BN store is doing a great job in fulfilling their social responsibility. BN has provided a space for area schools to have their Annual Bookfair for fundraising and Art Fair. In addition, they also offer 30% discount for teachers.",8/31/2010 14:50

There is a Starbucks here, of course. (Do they even allow Barnes & Nobles to exists without coffee shops anymore -- I mean, really?) There were a lot of tables and chairs in the cafe area, and this Starbucks served a full menu of food items, such as hot breakfast sandwiches, muffins, scones, bagels and all the various Starbucks edibles you and I know and love. 

The people who work here are courteous and knowledgable; they really know where everything is located. I asked a woman in the children's section if she could help me locate a particular book that I thought was in the children's section, and she kindly guided me to the adult section. Bingo! I found the book I was looking for.

Yes, prices are higher than used bookstores, but that's how it's always been. B&N always has great sales once or twice a month and has a huge clearance selection, so if you disagree with the price of a brand new hardback, either wait for the paperback or come back for a sale. Or, better yet, become a member and get ridiculous discounts on everything.

I come here all the time, and went to the store before it moved, and I've always had a great experience. The store is well organized (and ACTUALLY in alphabetical order) and now that they've moved, it's humongous. No more awkward aisle shuffling when someone else wants the same book as you. They don't mind if you sit and read for a bit, and the cafe is quick and friendly. Tech support for Nooks users is always available and they seem like they know what they're talking about. Now that I have a niece, I actually visit the children's section and appreciate that it's never a jumbled, grimy mess. They have everything labelled by age group to make it easy. 

As for the staff, they are always available and friendly and know their stuff. If I mention an author, odds are they know who it is and where to find it. If they don't have what you need in store, they jump at the chance to order it to be delivered to their store. The only reason I don't give this place five stars is because they suffer from the perpetual understaffed checkout line that many large retailers are afflicted with. I wouldn't blame customer service on that--I'd blame the chain.

Too bad the customer service is TERRIBLE.

I was extremely disappointed with the service that I received from my local store on 82nd street here in Indianapolis.  I had an issue with my one month old Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight.  I figured that it would be best to take it in to the local store, right?  WRONG!  The Nook rep there was not helpful and rude.  She basically told me that I must have done something to scratch my Nook, that it was my fault, and that she could not help me.  She admitted that she had never seen my issue before, but refused to do anything to help at all.  When I got home (obviously I was upset - I had only had my Nook for a month, and I was upset that B&N was not going to stand behind their product), I Googled my issue, and what do you know - it is a very common issue, a known problem with my particular Nook.  I called the local store again - once again got terrible customer service - asked to speak to the manager, who apparently was not available.  I asked for the manager to return my call - the rep on the line did not even ask for my name.  I asked who would be returning my call - ""Jeff.""  Jeff who? I asked - ""Jeff Peckman"".  Do you think that Jeff Peckman returned my call?  NOPE.  Terrible service - I will not be shopping at that store ever again.  It should not be too much to ask that B&N staffs their stores with people who actually know a few things about the product.  At least a little common courtesy?",6/19/2013 18:10

I do prefer small bookstores usually, but Barnes & Noble was so convenient and the only other bookstore in the area didn't have what I wanted.

As more readers grab books online, the need for giant bookstores might become a convenience rather than a primary source.  

So this chain has added lots of departments that aren't too far of a stretch from reading to appeal to customers and continue to bring them in.  Besides thousands of books, there was an artists supplies area, a video area, a toys and games area, periodicals, young readers, and a cafe!  Throw in convenient parking (free) out front and you could spend a lot of free time browsing the store, finding something of interest, and then grabbing something in the cafe so you don't have to wait to start reading!

Well kept and plenty of staff even on a Monday evening to assist customers find what they wanted.

I am a fan of the pizza pretzel.  This location is always clean and well kept.  I have also attended several Harry Potter events and the staff was open to hearing all of our feedback from the first event and made changes to the next event.

They have cut down their music and DVD section significantly, but you should still be able to find new releases. I like shopping on the website for either items I can't find in the store or if I just want to order material on line for a quick store pick up.

Diamond Virgin Hair Company is unprofessional and rude. I have never experienced such callous disregard from any well-known company. Mayven and HerImports are accessible and communicative with me. Even Aliexpress has excellent follow-up. The Diamond Virgin Hair Company team runs away and hides when a critique is made. Their product is not perfect. They are selling hair that is grown from other human beings. It will never be perfect, and some customers will have varying experiences while wearing your product. That should be expected, and there should be a plan in place to deal with such occurrences. The hair that I received sheds A LOT. The wefts are intact, the hair was not bleached, and it has been routinely cowashed. I have been experiencing this problem from day one. I reached out to them, and they never responded. 

Diamond Virgin Hair Company's lack of communication speaks volumes about the sustainability of this company. However, you all cannot negate the concerns of customers after accepting payment. They have no right to treat customers in this manner, and they cannot continue this practice. This behavior is why Diamond Hair Company is not number #1, and it must be corrected if they ever wish to be. 

The BBB must investigate these types of companies. Diamond Virgin Hair Company pays reviewers of social media to lure unsuspecting customers to their website. This company communicated with me about purchasing hair, but when the conversation became an inquiry about the quality of the hair that I received, the communicated ceased. There was no follow-up for over one year; that is customer abandonment. These practices need to be investigated and stopped. U.S. businesses must continue to uphold a certain standard.",5/11/2018 18:18

It continues to shed and tangle. This is not expected when purchasing a quality unit as advertise. For this wig to be close to 400 dollars; it has the quality of a beauty supply wig. It continues to shed and tangle and it's starting to thin. I am very unhappy. Spending close to 400 dollars for a wig I wouldn't expect this. I've reached out to the company and was advised of their 5 day return policy and they are unable to do anything about it. But offers me products on their website to help with shedding and tangling. It took me about a months to receive the wig and I already had a protective hair style before I was able to apply the wig for the first time . Two weeks later I wore the wig for the first time and the first day it  Shedded  and tangled with no added product. The wig was not manipulated the first wear. I manipulated the wig after I noticed it was thicker at the roots and thin(Almost see through at the ends). I simply plucked the part lightly and mold the hair with setting lotion this didn't help at all.

I had been asked by a few friends to try Diamond's Hair and let them know my experience.  It was absolutely the worst business transaction I have dealt with in a very long time.  Diamond accepted my payment and then gave me the run around about the status of my shipment for over a week.  I was told it would be shipped out on 3 occasions and it never was.  After I had enough I demanded a refund.  Magically, my hair was available that day and I could pick up (even though I had paid $13 for express shipping).   I needed the hair same day so I obliged.   As  if things couldn't get worse I drove 45 minutes to pick up the hair and they told me they had ""accidentally"" shipped it!!!!        And if that doesn't take the cake they sent me an email the next morning stating that they had shipped my product three days prior, which was an outright lie! 

I understand people make mistakes but the company was unprofessional  and they had to lie to boot.   The establishment looks great but they are VERY tacky when conducting business.  A GOOD company would have at the very least offered an accommodation or partial refund for their royal screw ups.  Then I may have actually come back.  I will be putting in a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, as this is unacceptable and apparently I wont be the first to do so.

She indicated she would return in a moment to place our order. After another 10 minutes she returns and took our order. My salad was right however we were not provided utensils, which I had to go fetch myself. My husband also inquired if a specific game could be showed on the tv. Our waitress stated she would check and returns to tell my husband he would need to ask all 8 folks sitting at the bar if it would be okay to change one of the tvs that's showing the same things as 2 other tvs. The final thing that has disappointed me and caused me to waste my time to make this complaint is that 2 men who arrived nearly 5 minutes after us placing our order were provided their food (nachos) before us who also had ordered one nacho.

-It was bikini night, and twin Peaks actually hires attractive, young girls, that guys enjoy having in our presence.
-No motorcycle gangs- we're in NE Indy, not Amarillo:) 
-Beer was f'n cold, great selection (Bells Oberon on tap), and the prices are reasonable.
-Above average bar food. 
-Large outside patio

CONS:
-Nothing special, as they didn't reinvent the wheel, as far as these types of restaurants are concerned.
-I'm sure some women's lib group classifies this establishment as sexist.
-I'm sure the LGBT mafia will demand that Twin Peaks hires a multitude of transgender species to flaunt their stuff...you know, because 3% of the population should dictate what the rest of the nation wants.
-I'm sure yelp HQ still hates me.

A decent place. I'd definitely return to watch the games, as there are tons of TV's, and the service was spot on as well.

It makes for a good place to get some beers and watch football with the guys, and at least this place is a little more unique than some of the other ones around.

I made it here on a Friday night to meet with a group of 10 friends. They had a large table reserved for us, and we were seated quickly. The place is really cool inside, with a lodge vibe that looks like something you would see up in the mountains. It was large, and it wasn't very full the one time I was here. There are more than enough TVs to see whatever sporting event you want to watch without having to turn your head very far.

Their menu consists of appetizers, burgers, sandwiches, and a surprising selection of dinner entrees. We ended up with a few appetizers that were pretty good, and a whole bunch of wings. I went with their ""smoked and grilled"" bone-in wings, which were phenomenal. I got them with sauce, but I would probably just get them plain with a sauce on the side since they were that good. They were some of the best wings I've had in the city. That being said, they were also pricier than most, but at least you get what you pay for.

I was surprised to see a decent selection of good local beers on tap. They also had a couple beers under the Twin Peaks brand, and quite a few of the largely distributed craft beer brands. And of course, you can always get an ice cold glass of light domestic stuff as well. 

Service, especially considering we had such a large group, was fantastic the entire time we were eating and drinking. Drinks never went empty before getting a refill and our food came out much quicker than expected. Unfortunately, for some reason that we never figured out, our server went MIA as we were wrapping up and we had to wait around a while before we could actually ask for checks. At least we were done, so the empty glasses and plates in front of us didn't need refilled, but it was still frustrating to be stuck there as we were ready to leave. If it wasn't for that snafu, the service would have gotten 5/5.

I don't have as much of a bias against large chain restaurants as the rest of Yelp tends to have, and I was very happy with what we ended up with out of this place. The food was great, our service was almost great, it is a neat place and there are lots of TVs, the beer list was probably the one shortfall and even it wasn't that bad.

No smile, no interest in the table (a tip for any waiter or waitress and isn't rocket science that's how one makes it in the industry working off of tips) which could have been fairly easy for her as it was just me a harmless 34 year old whom had been cutting down trees for several hours earlier to help a friend who can't do it on their own and as it was 95 out all I wanted was a cold beer and sandwich and the peaks was less than 5 blocks from the house I was at.

They actually have a digital reading on the wall of the beer temperature.  They serve it in a frosted 22oz mug.  

The beer was definitely cold that's for sure!  Once everyone else arrived, we started with some appetizers.  We ordered chips and queso with venison chili, two orders of stacked nachos with chicken, and two orders of fried pickles.  The kitchen was definitely moving slow, and it seemed like the front of the house was understaffed.  Both probably were.  The food arrived and was all pretty decent.  I ended up eating a whole order of nachos to myself and decided to be fat and order mozzarella bites for dinner.  Everyone else got actual entrees.  

Everyone seemed to enjoy the rest of their food.  I noticed on the way out there were a LOT of open tables all over the place but they were on a 45 minute wait.  There's no excuse for being understaffed on a Saturday in Castleton.  Not to mention there was a fight about to start which required a 5 dollar cover, I mean come on.

My waitress was Elizabeth...all the way from AZ...very pretty lady with tattoos and piercings. Anyway, I sat by the fireplace because I was cold (you would think ""why on a summer day?"")...I'm always cold.

Anyway I got the Steak salad (med. rare...just the way I like it) with a cilantro lime vinaigrette dressing. For the most part it was really good, I just wish it had a little sweetness to it, just to counter all of the savory flavors of the steak. My associate ordered the meatloaf with broccoli and mashed potatoes. The meatloaf looks like a steak. It's baked and grilled, however it is shaped like a steak. He said it was good. I didn't want to eat too much it was getting late. I contemplated on a dessert which was a bread pudding and some sort of brownie with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and a whole bunch of fixings...it sounded really good, I just think I was in the mood for something that heavy right before a movie.

Server took my order, but very quickly gave me the bill. Felt like they were trying to rush me out. Look I get it, spent years in restaurant business. But don't throw me the bill unless I ask for it, makes people feel like they are not allowed to order more. Especially when they don't even acknowledge that you are there after. Gave the server $20 on a &45 dollar bill. You would think they would try and get more out of me at that point!! But no, did not speak to me once after I paid. 
I understand that this place has a theme, and that's mainly what people go for. But that only gets you so far. I have gone through the reviews of this location and others. And I have not seen management even try and apologize once at this location, once!!Where as at the other one I looked at. First review I read management had responded.

The buffalo wings were the norm and the mozzarella cubes were okay. Nothing to write home about. My BLT was nicely prepared but I didn't care for the spicy bacon (may have been pepper bacon) and the lack of mayo. The sourdough  bread it was served on was really good. My date didn't care for the Philly steak n cheese. He said the bread wasn't very good. He said Penn Station is better. The fire fried that come with the sandwiches are thicker cute and pretty good.

Our waitress, Alyssa, was very friendly and brought us our beer pretty quick. It was the coldest beer I have ever had and it was served in a FROZEN glass not just frosted. The surface of the beer froze in about a minute. The beer was certainly a great experience.

Alyssa and the other waitresses were wearing tight tan shorts with red ""shirtinis"" (a word I just made up to mean a bikini top that has just a little more fabric to make it look like a shirt). They were for and friendly. 

The food was a mixed bag. I had the cheese bites as an appetizer. They were fantastic. My only complaint was that there weren't enough of them. My meal was  was the bbq bacon burger and fries. The fries were pretty good. They are a steak fry with a season salt. I would have liked more seasoning but my fiancé wanted less. The burger is the problem. It had great presentation and the bacon was done well but when I started getting into the burger, it fell flat on flavor. There was very little sauce and the meat didn't have a full grilled taste.

The parking lot was about half filled, but it looked like a lot less people inside as the restaurant is HUGE and very open. We were greeted by no less than 6 waitresses/hostesses standing around the hostess station. The person taking us to our table, who ended up being our waitress, decided to finish her conversation she was having with the other girls before seating us. It was kind of annoying, but she was very pleasant otherwise. 

The menu isn't extensive as others have previously mentioned. I decided on the ""hangover burger"" which is your basic hamburger with the addition of a fried egg on top. It was good but I have to say I prefer the Royal Red Robin over it. The fries served with it were pretty tasty with the seasoning they added to them. My Wife decided to just get the pulled pork nachos appetizer for her meal and we would share them. WOW there was a lot of food on that plate. They were very good, but I was too full to be of much help after my burger and we barely scratched the surface. At one point the waitress came by and said, ""I was going to tell you how big they were after you ordered them.""......haha ok why didn't you? We took them home and had them the next day. No big deal. 

My favorite part about Twin Peaks, besides the obvious, was how cold the beer was! They are very proud of how cold they keep the beer as there is an indicator on the wall keeping customers informed of just how cold it was. It fluctuated from 27 to 30 degrees while we were there. While there isn't an overabundance of choices, it was super refreshing. The top of the beer had small ice crystals forming it was so cold. DELICIOUS! Especially on a 90 degree day.

The Indy 500.  While thousands rushed to the track to drown themselves in alcohol in the blazing sun watching race cars zoom across the track going at speeds I've never traveled, I learned in the background.  I made a decision to go in search of a good spot to watch the race on television yesterday and that is a good thing today.  It sent me spiraling to Twin Peaks, a place I had listed on my calendar and scratched off the original day I chose to go.  Still my sub-conscious would not let me forget what I had tried to erase.  It pushed me in that direction and I arrived and met my destiny restoring the balance of today.  I walked in with a quarter.  I ordered a water and sat at the bar.  My bartender was a seasoned veteran.  She'd been there since it opened.  Her next career goal in life is to be a housewife.  I sat there for hours, just learning from the environment and her.  The pack sitting to my left get louder as their drinks keep getting refilled.  One of them speaks up and decides to order shots for the group.  I chime in, can I have one too?  No.  Then he changes his mind, calls it karma, and orders me up one.  Did we just become best friends?  No.  I soon learn what attracts me to the bartender, she reminds me of a person I knew in the past, Heather.  Coincidentally enough, a red head strolls into the bar to work next to my bartender and her name is Heather.  So I spend a few hours there just learning and being in the space.  I'm not a king.  I say at one point to the guy who bought the shots.  Kiss the ring bitch.  His response, drowning himself in booze.  When him and his pack are about to leave, he bows and kisses my hand.  

I return after a visit home for a nap and dinner.  My bartender and Heather are still there, grinding it through on a Sunday race day.  I order a glass a house red and the banana pudding.

The servers do wear low cut shirts and shorts, but nothing that was any different than other themed sports bars. When I was there, there were groups of women together and also couples there. There were a few families with children there. 

The food is what made me give it a try....well that and the ridiculously cold beer. 

I am a big fan of nachos....good nachos. Twin peaks has good nachos, very good nachos. they are big enough for 2-3 people and be pretty full. We ate mostly appetizers while we were there. We had the sampler plate which has mozzarella bites, Fried Pickles and Boneless buffalo bites. They were really good. Even with them being fried they were not soggy from grease. Have boneless chicken instead of bone on wings in a sampler was a great surprise and was welcomed with an open mouth. I also had The cup of chili and it was very flavorful and I wish I would have got The bowl of chili instead. The food over all was above average for a sports bar. next time we might move to entrees next time.

For dessert we had the bread pudding and it was really good. I would definitely get it again. My wife are the ice cream and brownie dessert. She would get it again also. I also wanted the apple dessert they had on the menu, but the server says they don't carry it and wishes they would take it off them menu if they don't plan on carrying it.

It is my new favorite sports bar. Almost forgot they have a crazy amount of TVs and they are numbered so you can ask the server to change that tv to a game you would like to watch. They also have tvs over all the urinals in the men's room.",11/4/2015 16:52

I wanted it, and I got it, and I loved it.  I had their brew, the Knotty Brunette.  It's a dark brown beer, but lighter than a lager.  I was surprised at how light tasting it is, and I really like it.  We had the sirloin steak with garlic mashed and broccoli and the bread pudding for dessert.  The steak was prepared properly and not tough, the mashed potatoes had just the right taste of garlic without over powering, and the broccoli was cooked without being wilted to death.  The bread pudding had the texture of almost a cake and had raisins and a nice bourbon sauce topped with ice cream.  Loved how many TV's were in every direction.  The inside space is huge, they have two bars, and the decor is really cute.  While it is true that this is the type of place whose staff are young ladies with low cut tops and high cut shorts, it's not too extreme, and the frosty beer is just worth it.",4/4/2016 20:21

The hostess wasn't that friendly and didn't seem to be happy that we were there.  Always a good start....

There are more BIG TV's than any place I've ever visited.  There are almost too many if that's possible.  It was a little annoying that even though all of the TV's were the same size and model they couldn't sync the color adjustments so it made for uncomfortable viewing.  At least the feed was all in sync timing wise.

Our server was very attentive and friendly  I ordered the fish tacos which were very good and my wife had the meatloaf which she also enjoyed.  I had a few draft beers which were quite cold.  I didn't really like the frosty mugs though.  They had too much frost and I ended up with a lot of ice in all three of the beers I ordered.

The other servers that walked by seemed to be going through the motions and were never smiling.  They really made it kind of an uncomfortable environment.  I think if they would smile a little it would go a long way to making the place more enjoyable.

Overall the place just seems too large and not the kind of place I would like to hang out and watch sports.  If you advertise cold beer why does it have to come in an icy cup.  It kind of ruins the beer when there is that much ice floating in it.",1/13/2016 15:14

I am pretty sure a fruit fly problem comes from miss managed liquor bottles at the bar. At least, that is what I have learned from Bar Rescue.

Besides that....The food was awesome. I love wings, and their wings were top notch. I got my wings breaded like I would at Hooters, and their breading is nice and crisp. Their sauces are good although not as many to choose from as Buffalo Wing Wings. In always better than Wings, Etc. I liked their wings above all wings because of the breading. You can get them without breading too.

They have two beers that are made for them. One they claimed was like a Blue Moon, but Blue Moon is better. The other is a brown ale. Both were good. They advertise 29 degree cold beer. I had to be that temperature, because it was slightly slushy at the top. I would rather the beer just be in the high 30's. No need to have ice in me beer.

They have TVs at all the booths from what I could tell. It was really neat to watch a college football game at my table. The restaurant sound system was turned to play that game over the speaker system. On a side note, not all the tables were turned to the same channel. Not sure if you can get it changed for your table or not.

We went to go find a table to sit at to order food with a better experience and made a comment to the hostess letting her know about our service where we were then confirmed by Symone who was crying and explained that she was busy and did the best that she could. Her bar had 5 groups of people at most at it and there were quite a few empty chairs. We asked for a manager who came out and accused us of not understanding and that they were doing no wrong. He was very rude and not customer friendly. The atmosphere they create here is one similar to high school. Where gossip is the number one priority. The managers act as if they are never in the wrong and that the customers bad experience was just a fluke.

The waitresses are very nice, and the food comes out very quickly.  Yesterday when I went I noticed alot of families are there to eat. There are a ton of TV's with different sporting games being played. If you order an appetizer wait a minute to order your meal because the food comes out that fast.  I like to take my time eating my appetizer.  
The food so yesterday I got the loaded potato soup and it was so, so good. I asked for green onions on the side to add to my soup.  That soup was so good not salty at all.  It had fresh bacon, potatoes and cheese.  
We also order fried pickles which was enough pickles to feed 4 people.  It comes with ranch,  and they were not greasy at all.  They were a mild flavor pickle so not tart.  I had the cheeseburger and added bacon for .99 cents.  The bacon is a nice thick cut of bacon.  The burger comes with lettuce,  tomato,  grilled onions, and mustard. The bun did break apart on the bottom for some reason. The patty is a thick piece of meat and it was very good.  
I will definitely go back I would like to try their Cuban sandwich.  I was going to get it but she said it's on a hoagie bun.  I would like to see if they can do that sandwich on their Texas toast they serve with the soup.  
Lastly,  I would like to see this restaurant have the tables/ bar top table more spread.  It's like part of the restaurant is social distancing and part of it is not. They are located in Marion County so the capacity should be less according to the Governor rules.  The restaurant both times has been packed with every table filled.  People do wear there mask to the bathroom,  and around the restaurant.  When seated our table was not clean so I asked to sit some where else.

There have slowly added women of color to the team of waitresses but they don't seem to stick around very long. One night, my friends and I came in for fight night and the place was jammed packed. They took our money at the door and there were no seats available for us to sit in. So we had to stand and hope that four people would leave so that we could be seated. Managers were rude when we asked about it. Probably because there were cops with them that were working in the building that night which is not surprising. We finally spot a table of four leaving and then four guys that had just walked in the building and who just so happened to be white men hurried up and sat at that table and we told them that we were there before they were and management told us that they were there before we were. We knew this wasn't true but it put us all in a potentially bad situation. We are not trouble makers but we were very angry. Especially since all they had to do is write down names at the door and keep track of tables. We saw a waitress arguing with another group of black men for the same reason at the same time and they told us the same thing had happened to them. The point of this review is this: Far too many times black people are treated as if their money is different. The music reflects that and the service does as well. We need to have our own establishments but the city wouldn't allow this to happen due to the ""good old boy system with land and properties"".

On the other hand, if you stumble into the brand new Indianapolis location of the Texas-based chain of ""breastaurants"" called Twin Peaks hoping to enjoy some good eats, good drinks, and scenic views, then you'll likely be incredibly happy. 

Founded in 2005 in Lewisville, Texas, Twin Peaks opened for the dinner hour starting on 12/8/14 at the former Loon Lake Lodge just East of Castleton at the corner of I-69 and East 82nd Street. 

With its servers all wearing the trademark Twin Peaks cleavage and midriff-baring red plaid tops and khaki shorts, the concept behind Twin Peaks may sound familiar but this variation on the familiar theme is far less kitschy and far more personable than other similarly themed restaurants.

The easiest way to describe Twin Peaks is sports bar meets hunting lodge meets bevy of beautiful women. For those who remember Loon Lake Lodge and its abundance of hunting-themed decor, it makes sense that Twin Peaks choose this spot as its first Indianapolis location. The restaurant has multiple truly accessible parking spots and a set of rather light doors leading into the larger than you expect restaurant. As they just started serving dinners only on Monday of this week and open for regular business hours starting Saturday (12/13/14), the spirit in the restaurant was festive and friendly with multiple staff from the chain's Dallas area headquarters on location for training purposes. Thus, you get greeted at the door by enough beautiful women to make you dream for weeks. 

I worried a little as I arrived as the first bar area and first couple dining areas feature high-top tables/chairs that aren't wheelchair friendly. There's no reason to worry. Twin Peaks has multiple areas that are wheelchair friendly and I had no trouble navigating the restaurant (and was encouraged to do so). 

The menu consists of mostly American fare of a South, Southwest, and Heartland flavor with burgers, chicken, appetizers, a few other sandwiches, and a handful of meals. There's a large alcohol menu, of course, and a couple of desserts. There are two main bar areas, at least 3-4 larger dining areas, a small area known as the ""man cave,"" and there are wide-screen televisions throughout the restaurant and in the bathrooms!

I ordered a concoction known as the Smokehouse Burger with ""fire fries"" for $10.95 plus another couple bucks for my usual iced tea. I tend to be a rather simple burger guy and this particular burger was a bit out of my comfort zone. This may explain why I didn't find it completely satisfying. It tasted a tad underdone. It included cheddar cheese, red onion, BBQ sauce, bacon, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, and pickles. The burger was easily my least favorite part of the experience, though I'd still put it in the 3-3.5 range. The fries were perfectly seasoned and stellar. The iced tea was also perfection and I did receive my usual refill. 

The highlight of the entire experience was Amanda, and not just because she was beautiful (though she was). She was attentive, personable, outgoing, and just seemed natural. She also scored points for sitting down to talk to me, not just because it's really hard to sit in a wheelchair and have a normal conversation with a skimpily clad young woman but because being at wheelchair height causes the neck to constantly have to stretch and it's nice when someone meets you eye-to-eye. Unlike that ""other"" chain that comes to mind, these young women all seemed comfortable with disability and Amanda, in particular, seemed natural and at ease (NOTE: I did learn she has a brother who is deaf. I'm sure that helps). 

While it was a little slow during the 5pm hour in which I arrived at Twin Peaks, I was impressed with Amanda's personable nature and ability to talk about work, disability, sports, food and, yes, even what it's like to work in a place with an outfit that would make most of us blush. It was refreshingly awesome and, to be honest, not what I expected when I entered the doors. 

The service was stellar. The food was good, though I'll likely stick to my comfort zone next time. The decor was warm, inviting, and wheelchair friendly. The views, as their slogan notes, definitely scenic. While I do lean toward the shy side, I think it's human nature to appreciate a little extra attention and, as Twin Peaks notes on its website, the Twin Peaks girls offer an abundance of ""girl next door"" charisma and playful personalities.

The restaurant decor puts you in the vibe of if you did a annual hunting trip what your cabin in the woods would look just like. Except this cabin was complete with the elite hooter restaurant waitresses lol. With that being said the servers here are amazing! Hands down  top notch service not just good to look at. These are really well trained servers that understand customer service they even make time for small talk. They kind of double teamed my table the whole time and were really on top of making sure my glass stayed refreshed and I got everything I needed before I actually needed it.

The wings are the star here you can get them a variety of ways.... breaded, non breaded, bone in or out, and the champ of them all smoked then grilled with a array of sauces, naked, or dry rubbed!!

All the food was fresh and cooked perfect. all the ingredients in my cobb tasted fresh and clean with a huuge portion bigger than most dinner salads. The burgers were great as well. Nothing really bad to say except I wish they were closer so I can frequent them!",8/3/2020 6:24

311,XkL8GyAsIB6nuq9O-Fpi9Q,fbO2EDVPgRk5UQ8NE7QVHw,seKihQKpGGnCeLuELRQPSQ,2,3,3,2,"After driving by Twin Peaks daily for months, we decided to finally pop in to see what all the fuss was about.  We had noticed that the parking lot was PACKED the first few months it was open and initial Yelp reviews were touting Indy's newest breast-aurant as the place to be.  Also, we were curious to see how the cool old Loon Lake Lodge had been transformed in to the new space.

We visited at about 6:30 on a balmy 89 degree Sunday night and were seated on the large wrap-around patio at a huge, tall, heavy wooden table.  There are TVs EVERYWHERE -- hanging back to back over each of our heads, 4 on the wall beside us -- just EVERYWHERE.  The tables on the patio are massive and easily sit 6, and some inside (inside it is HUGE!) looked to seat 10+ or more -- with several smaller parties divided up by a slider depicting an ax through the table.  There was a fire pit at the corner of the patio as well.  

Our scantily clad yet overdressed for the weather (more on this later) little teeny-tiny server was completely friendly, but lacked menu knowledge aside from ""these 2 sandwiches have an egg on them and if you like fish we have trout and fish tacos"".  We later learned that sweet ""Bambi"" had just been in training last week, so we cut her some slack.  

Beer options were surprisingly super limited (no local or craft beers offered), but I decided to give the Dirty Blonde house brew a try -- reminded me of Blue Moon -- served in a big ol' super frosty mug at 29 degrees. I must say it is really tasty with an orange wedge!  

We got the hand braided pretzel ($5) for an app -- served with warm beer cheese (made with the house beer Knotty Brunette) and grainy brown mustard.  Decent.  Greasy(?) but decent.

The food menu is not diverse, folks.  Healthy food eaters beware -- aside from 2 'loaded' salads (a cobb and one other), there were zero real options for a health nut.  Even the broccoli was listed as ""sauteed"" on the menu.  

I threw caution to the wind and for dinner I picked the fish tacos and subbed out the chips and salsa for the mac and cheese (topped with bacon).  The hubs got the Smokehouse Burger and fire fries.  While my fish had a good season on it, there just wasn't a whole lot of it, but there WAS a ton of the cabbage slaw on top.  The mac and cheese was just ok.  Hub's burger came with 2 patties even though he specified just one patty (it is an option for a few bucks less), so he took one patty off.  The patties appeared a little Mc-pre-formed and flat-top cooked -- not grilled.  Disappointing.  The fries were just regular thick cut frozen steak fries with some ""cajun"" seasoning on them.  Meh.    

Food aside, I do have 2 general gripes to share.  Uh oh... 
-- I feel that I need to advocate for the servers here when it comes to their uniform -- and no, not in the feminist ""women are being objectified at Twin Peaks"" kind of way.  What I mean is this -- it was almost 90 friggin degrees outside and you have these gals in thick knee socks and black Ugg boots?  Sure, the top 1/2 of their body gets plenty of ventilation, but seriously?  That footwear and sock combo? And as a former server I know that non-slip shoes in the kitchen were a must... what happened here, folks??  And is Ugg material even sanitary with food rehash and kitchen gunk on them?  Sorry -- just had to be said.

-- My biggest gripe of the whole deal is that they allow smoking on the covered patio while people dine and it is mere feet from the doors in to the restaurant.  There was a dirty ash tray on our table when we sat down and patrons from inside were stepping ""out"" around our table to smoke while we were trying to stomach a meal.  YUCK.  We even had to ask the young men at the table next to us to kindly turn off the fan mounted above their table as it was blowing their smoke directly at us.  UGH. This seriously put a damper on our meal and overall experience.

All in all, I would give our TP experience a one and a half star rating based on the pricey meh-esque food and the aforementioned gripe alone, but the beer was good and our server was really sweet.  I just don't see us rushing back to Twin Peaks for another $50 meal any time soon.  Perhaps to watch a game and have a beer, but not for the lackluster food.",6/9/2015 16:37

Such is the case with Twin Peaks.  I was so impressed with the food and the service at lunch (Arielle was my server) that I had to come back! From the moment I arrived, I was greeted with friendly smiles and a courteous staff.  While the place was very busy, there was no long wait.  Almost immediately after I was seated, Arielle was there checking on what I'd like to drink and answering my specific questions about the menu.  While I've had people at other restaurants seem irritated when I ask questions, Arielle seemed eager to answer my questions and came across as very authentic and helpful.  Her service was over-the-top, too  (not once did I go lacking for anything), but two other things stood out in my mind as well.  While Twin Peaks is a sports-bar/restaurant, they're very family friendly.  That's unusual for many sports bars/restaurants I've visited. Singles, couples, families, and sports enthusiasts waiting to watch the games were all present. And I can't begin to describe how delicious the food was!  For lunch I had ""Mom's Pot Roast,"" but to be honest mom never made it this great.  My dessert was a Twin Peaks Sundae that was amazing.  For my return trip at dinner, I specifically asked if Arielle was available.  I was informed I was in luck.  She had worked a longer shift than usual today.  I wanted to eat lighter, so I had a cup of Blonde Bean with Bacon Soup (delicious!) and asked Arielle specific questions about the items on the dessert menu I still hadn't tried.  (Again, there was no impatience or indifference.  She was warm and friendly and seemed eager to assist me in making my decision.) I decided to go for the Mini Apple Turnovers with Ice Cream and Caramel Sauce.   They were fantastic, but for something with ""mini"" in the name, I wasn't expecting such a generous serving.  My whole experience (both visits) was fantastic!    As I'm scheduled to leave Indie in a few days (work trip), I regret I won't be able to try many of the other items on the menu until I get back into town.  I can wholeheartedly recommend Twin Peaks to anyone looking for great food, great service, fantastic atmosphere, and great value!  I'll definitely be back!",4/16/2018 3:00

So when my friends decided to go out for a pint before an event on Friday, Twin Peaks seemed like the best (and only) choice. I'm not a huge fan of ""titty restaurants"" like this to be honest because I hate that an establishment's theme is around women wearing revealing clothes as they wait on you. It seems rather sexist. But, that's just me being a prude. I'm also not a big sports bar person, as I find all of the TVs to be rather distracting for good conversation over dinner. But, Twin Peaks wasn't that terrible.

Our waitress was very friendly (and not just for the sake of garnering more tips). She legitimately seemed like a nice gal. She wasn't quite knowledgeable on all items on the menu though. Even if your serving at a place that's not a 5-star restaurant, you should still be able to recommend a few things off the menu if you can for the benefit of your customers. She also was a little slow to get to and from our table with our drinks, which I found odd since we were seated right by where the waitresses request drinks of their bartenders.

As for the drinks, VERY sweet. I ordered some kind of boozy lemonade off their drink specials menu, and it was mostly simple syrup/sour mix. Maybe this makes me a functional alcoholic, but I like to taste a little nip of the booze in my drink and not just sweet and sour. I had a taste of one of their house beers (all of which are themed with some kind of lumberjack name) and it was decent. Not anything to go out of your way for, but I could definitely tell this was more of a beer joint than a mixed drink place. Perhaps the bartenders are used to pouring more pints than mixing liquor drinks for all the men coming in to this watering hole.

The food was decent. Twin Peaks definitely redeemed itself in this area. I had some of the mozzarella bites to start, which were quite tasty -- lightly breaded and fried with molten cheese in the center...you can't go wrong with these. I also tried a few bites of the blackened fish tacos -- also very decent with a tangy chipotle mayo that came on them.

After our event, we ended up coming back to Twin peaks for another round and some of the gals came and chatted with us at our table. It was a nice distraction from all of the TVs that were vying for our attention in the place. I can't say that Twin Peaks will be my regular watering hole, but it is convenient, not terribly expensive, and they about the only interesting bar in the Castleton area with PLENTY of seating for a group.",5/17/2016 14:29

He had a personality! That alone will bring me back.

The food.. I ordered the Philly cheese steak. That's always my go to sandwich to get. The seasoning on the need was amazing. The sandwich was full of mushroom onions and cheese. Best Philly I have had! And their on tap beer is ice cold. Coldest beer I have ever been served.

Atmosphere... It was very lumberjacky. When you pull in onto a horrible busted up parking lot and look at a lovely log cabin style building you are wondering why they dont fix parking lot. The staff is wearing short shorts and barely any shirt. I personally dont care but keep that in mind ladies if you are the jealous type.

It has your basic guys sports bar theme similar to a hooters or tilted kilt when it comes to scantly  clad women. I will say this though, these girls seemed like they truly enjoyed working there and wasn't just working there because of lack of options. 

Also where twin peaks is beating a hooters or tilted kilt is they have a much more dynamic food selection. Not just wings pizza and beer (which they also have).

Now to the dining experience - my buddy and I ordered onion rings and fried pickles to start. They were pretty good. Only issue is they don't give you a menu. You have to ""scan"" their bar code symbol with your phone camera to access their menu. Ugh. 
I kept thinking what would my 88 yr old mother do since she doesn't have a smart phone. But then I suppose she wouldn't be a patron at this establishment. 

My friend ordered the Mom's meatloaf  which is his go to meal here. I made the never ending mistake of ordering the chicken fried steak. I will never again order chicken fried steak outside the state of Texas. I don't care where you go - Texas Roadhouse, Charleston's, Twin Peaks, they all use the same food vendor which gives a chewy cutlet that sits heavy in your stomach. NEVER AGAIN!!

To wash everything down I had 3 beers. Heinekens. The first one was on tap but didn't taste like Heineken so I switched to bottles. Meh.

The highlight of the night was arriving at 7:30 to watch the Colts game and at 8:15 we were informed that because there was a fight on that night each patron would be assessed a $5 cover charge. F that!!! We complained and were getting ready to head over to Ale Emporium when we were informed that due to numerous complaints the $5 fee was waived.

Several long time friends of mine from the Broad Ripple area all told me to try this new place out.

1) You took over the Chumley's location which used to have 50? taps.  Now you have 24.  You are a taproom in Broad Ripple and in the IBJ article you talk about how your selection of beers is going to be different.  I saw maybe 2 beers that were slightly unique.

2) My dinner date and I ordered a Mule each.  Very good!

3) She ordered your Chorizo Mac-n-cheese.  Flavor was good.  But honestly, it looked like hamburger helper.

4) I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  It was unevenly cooked.  One end was dry and chewy.  The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken

5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried.  just meh.  some way overcooked and some chewy.

6) PLEASE get rid of the generic ketchup/condiments.  At a minimum go with Red Gold - a local company.  Again, in the IBJ article you talk about how everything is freshly made and locally sourced.

7) LOVED our waitress.

I was really bummed that they took out half the taps and made that remaining selection pretty lame. It didn't help that the one beer I actually wanted they were out of. They also increased the prices of the 'schooner' fills (to the point where it wasn't even a tiny bit of a deal) and reduced the options of what you could put in them. Service was fairly slow, but not as slow as many of these other reviews have indicated.

I'm a beer-lover who strives to always try different things, so a diverse and changing selection is essential to me. I was already really taken aback by the significant reduction in choices, but then to rename the place as a Tap Room? What a slap in the face.

With HopCat across the street, The Pint Room just a hop over in Carmel, and TwentyTap a few blocks south in SoBro, I have literally no reason to ever go back. Additionally, The Sinking Ship only has 8 taps, but they are expertly managed and always have great things. Flat Water has a similarly small number of taps, but their food is anything but basic bar food.

I'm not really sure who the Village Tap Room is trying to appeal to, despite their claimed demographic of ""an older crowd.""",1/17/2016 17:55

Several long time friends of mine from the Broad Ripple area all told me to try this new place out.

1) You took over the Chumley's location which used to have 50? taps.  Now you have 24.  You are a taproom in Broad Ripple and in the IBJ article you talk about how your selection of beers is going to be different.  I saw maybe 2 beers that were slightly unique.

2) My dinner date and I ordered a Mule each.  Very good!

3) She ordered your Chorizo Mac-n-cheese.  Flavor was good.  But honestly, it looked like hamburger helper.

4) I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.  It was unevenly cooked.  One end was dry and chewy.  The other end I had to double check to make sure it wasn't raw - it had that odd crunchy feel of undercooked chicken

5) the house fries are a sliced potato that is deep fried.  just meh.  some way overcooked and some chewy.

6) PLEASE get rid of the generic ketchup/condiments.  At a minimum go with Red Gold - a local company.  Again, in the IBJ article you talk about how everything is freshly made and locally sourced.

7) LOVED our waitress.

they say they are open for breakfast on the weekends.  OK, does 10 a.m. really mean breakfast?  Their IBJ article says they are going after an older crowd - to be honest an older crowd is already hours into their day at 10 a.m.   Our breakfast group meets at 8:30 because most of us are small business owners and have things to get done.

Still hadn't been waited on so we left to go some where else.

Don't cry too hard about it, Chum Hums, because walking in, the ghost of Chumley's past seemed to be floating around.  Two weeks in, the setup is the same, the TVs are still in prime locations, and the local beer is all there in drafts, cans, and bottles.  

However, there are changes in the several menus given to you, starting with the cocktail menu.  Our server boasted that the head bartender studied the art of old timey cocktails intensely, reading for six months straight before ever picking up a bottle.  It seems to be the new pride and joy of Village Tap Room.  I apologize for not being about to tell you more about them, because I'm a beer gal through and through.  I can say that I drank my 3 Floyd's Yum Yum with great content, knowing that it was one of many, many beers and ciders to choose from.

And now my pride and joy: food hunting.  Most of you know that I make it my mission to find something tasty everywhere I go.  Smack dab in the center of the food menu was PUFFY TACOS in caps.  I tried to steer away from it--it could be a ploy--but your standard steakburger and tenderloin pub fare were not calling my name.  I chose shredded chipotle chicken as my protein (other options are chorizo, short rib, and pulled pork)  and mango salsa (I wasn't in a charred chipotle mood) to accompany it.  Two puffy tacos and $7 later, I feel confident about my decision of inflated fried flour tortillas stuffed with tender, spiced shredded chicken, sprinkled cheddar cheese, diced tomato, crunchy iceberg lettuce, and mango salsa.  I like knowing that I have a solid go-to if someone wants to sit along the windows, people watch, and drink a pint.

The beer special is decent with a fairly good selection. The beers are expensive straight up ($6-8), but you can drink a scooner of craft beer (32 oz) for $5. 

This last visit I didn't eat my meal. I ordered the steak burger medium with chipotle salsa (I was experimenting). The steak burger was well done as was my friend who also ordered medium. The buns were the cheap, wonderbread, kind you get in the 12-pack for a block party bbq. The chipotle salsa appeared to just be some salsa from a common brand container.

I was not impressed, with the exception of one employee who was terrific.  I showed up for a ""tap takeover""....which was anything but.  

Grabbing a seat at the bar.... the first thing to notice was nearly the entire staff gathered at the service station and yapping to each other....never mind the customers...lets stare at our phones, show each other FB posts, and generally do anything that doesn't resemble ""service"".

Exactly 11 minutes and 15 seconds after sitting down, and finally a nice woman inquired as to whether I had been helped.  Nope, not yet !   Don't think my time banished to Irrelevant Island was wasted time....indeed...I was treated to a very entertaining display of the virtuosity of a tres cool bartender totally focusing his benevolent attention on two younger women who giggled and cooed in appreciation of his irreverent commentary and display of serious bartender mad magic skills....this man walked in front of me no less than 9 times...and I am grateful he failed to notice the guy with the red sweatshirt and giant phone....as this allowed the Flirt Show to continue unabated.  Regrettably the two young women were probably a bit disappointed when he would leave to share what undoubtedly were insanely humorous anecdotes and impossibly beneficial life changing commentary to his coworkers at the opposite end of the bar.

This was followed by a man emerging from the bowels of the restaurant with a cash drawer...who could not muster a smile or a hello to customers that presumably might fill said cash drawer.

The beer selection was typical, and fine. But hardly earth shattering in terms of variety...fewer taps than the previous incarnation. The menu IMO, showed little imagination in terms of offerings, and what unfortunately passes as acceptable food in the Midwest.  Basically nothing even remotely healthy....deep fried tacos ""Puffy"" as a signature dish in the middle of the menu ???   Maybe at a college dive bar....but for a place purportedly appealing to an ""older"" crowd....not so much.  Their supposed commitment to ""locally sourced"", or whatever similar term they use, is dubious at best.  Most items appeared to be the type that COULD be fresh off the Sysco truck and right out of the freezer.  

I was afforded further entertainment opportunities watching what few customers were in the place....attempting to flag down their servers for things like water and napkins.  Hint to all servers....if ya are bringing things like Philly cheese steaks, wings, nachos....bring extra napkins.  Don't make customers hold up their hands as if just after washing and just prior to surgery...in an attempt to keep well sauced fingers from soiling their clothing.

Nice tvs, and plenty of them, in... I believe the same locations as before....and as is fairly common across this great land of chain restaurants.  The décor is an upgrade of the previous tenant....but the weird to me.... sort of half-barrel booths in the middle of floor may be sufficiently innovative to appeal to folks looking for a bit of privacy while still enjoying being part of the action.  I however, prefer not to be ensconced, thereby not hindering my creepy ostentatious gazing of hot chicks.

Looking forward to a return visit...but...will wait for them to hopefully improve the service....and maybe some more interesting and healthier food items.",11/24/2015 13:16

We ordered three things off the menu to share:

Mac and Cheese with Chorizo: It was ok at best and it did not look at all appealing. 

Chicken Wings:  They were small and really had no flavor ( we ordered them hot) there are way too many places to go to have good wings (Keystone Sports Review or Fat Dan's) to think about coming here again for wings

Potato Skins:  These were good, but really, how hard is it to cut up a baked potato, put some cheese and crumbled bacon on top and stick it under the broiler a second to melt the cheese.

After looking over the displays a couple times, I asked and found out that you can buy the chocolates by the piece or by the pound.  I thought it best to go with individual pieces and limited my purchase so that my waistline stayed relatively the same size as when I started the day.  I decided to get a pecan snapper in milk chocolate (snapper = turtle), a cashew snapper in milk chocolate, and a dark chocolate covered pretzel.  
Because the pieces are handmade, they are on the pricey side.  (After tax, it was nearly $8!)

The flavor was really good.  The snappers were fairly large compared to the ones you see in those assortment boxes.  They were filled with nuts and creamy gooey caramel.  The only problem was that since it was a hot day, I had a bit of a mess as the chocolate melted.  (Fear not, I am not above licking my fingers to savor the last bit of it!)

buy it on sunday

I forgot I couldn't buy on Sunday... What's the Indy loophole?  You can buy alcohol in restaurants, wineries, and now, CRAFT BREWERIES.   Aptly named after the German form for ""beer"", I went to the most inspirationally named brewery, Bier. Mid-September, I was hoping for some fall inspired beers, but I think they were kicking the kegs for summer.  Whatevs, I tried several ""flavors"" and ended up grabbing a growler of the whit reminiscent of a Hoegaarden or Allagash White.  

Their nano-like brewing process is really brilliant.  They have different beers every week, and I imagine, it keeps the locals good and hydrated.  The taproom's pretty cool tool: lots of space, big TV, couch, darts, beer, all you need really.  

Only complaint: a bit expensive for growlers.  But you got a keep a great operation like this going somehow!  That is: moola.

I first stopped into Bier Brewery two days ago after learning of them on Beer Advocate. I was fortunate enough to show up when they weren't too busy and was able to chat with Ben and Jerry, two personable and engaging staff behind the bar, and a few other friendly customers. Bier's line-up tends to be on the less bitter side, which makes me extremely happy. Of the seven or eight beers I tasted, most ranged from 10-20 IBUs (International Bittering Units scale, a measurement of a beer's bitterness, with 0 as the lowest possible). Only one rated at 50 or above, and even that tasted delicious!

When I visited a couple days ago, I picked up a growler of Weizengoot, my favorite of the seven. It had an enticing deep-orange hue and looked simply fantastic. The first sip tasted faintly like Blue Moon, but the finish felt closer to Hoegaarden -- an excellent combination, yet still wonderfully unique. Since I had to share, the growler lasted less than an hour! I stopped into Bier again this afternoon -- Sunday growler sales in Indiana are a beautiful thing! -- but was mildly disappointed to discover  that Bier had already sold out of the Goot. Blast! 

Instead, I chose my second favorite -- Chamomille Wheat. Another delicious wheat beer, somehow light-tasting yet full-bodied? Yes, please. The growler is now nearly empty... and I didn't have to share this time!

While the prices ($12-14 for a fill) are just a touch high (I'm spoiled by $6-9 fills), they're well worth it for such fantastic beer -- and for supporting such a great, up-and-coming small business. They're such relative newcomers, their beer is only sold on the premises -- you can't buy it in any bars or stores, but I imagine that will quickly change once word gets out and they're able to ramp up production.

In short, I can't wait to go back to Bier. Next time, I'll be bringing two or three growlers with me!",3/27/2011 23:22

The location is pretty easy to get to as long as it isn't rush hour, and they have plenty of parking in the parking lot for the strip mall of businesses that they are set up in. There is quite a bit of outdoor seating in a patio area in front of the business, and a lot more seating inside that is composed of some second-hand mismatched furniture (including a few couches). Ordering is done at their bar that has a large chalkboard behind it with the available beers on tap.
 
It's a fairly busy interior with lots of stuff hanging everywhere, including a significant amount of awards that they have won for their beers. There are also lots of branded items that you can buy. They have 6-packs of their canned beer already cold that you can purchase to-go, or you can make a build your own 6 pack. You can also fill growlers here. The beers from this brewery are always done exceptionally well for the style, but they also lack some of the more unique beers that a lot of other breweries like to make. They have 8 or 9 beers on tap at any time, and they usually cover a decent spectrum of beer styles. This is definitely a brewery that isn't going to put out anything that isn't done well.

They have quite a few unique events here that can be easily found on their website, including a night especially for dogs, live music, and even a euchre night. Wednesday is their pint night with the fantastic offering of $4 pints. There was a food truck here the last time I visited, but I think that is only a once a week occasion (but don't quote me on that). They did have a few snack items available if needed to buy something to tide you over while drinking. 

I don't make it here very often since it requires a drive to get here, but it is definitely a stop I would make if I was going to be in the area. If you like great beer in a relaxed atmosphere, this is definitely your place. Additionally, and this may be a little judgmental of me, but the crowd here seems to be a little more ""normal"" than some other breweries.

Since 2012, it seems Bier Brewery has had prize winners.  So the bar is set pretty high for your drinking experience.

I have had a number of their canned beverages around town.  They make a variety of brews including Special K (kolsch), Weizengoot (Hefewizen), and PDG (""Pretty Darn Good"" American pale).  I have enjoyed them all!

The interior is dim and filled with assorted tables, chairs, and a lounge area.  The restrooms have been designated as Stouts and Blondes, so I guess that is understood to be gender neutral (I hope so since I am neither stout, at least not yet, or blonde!)

In the back corner is the counter/tap area with a list of the current taps artistically displayed on the chalkboard.  One thing I liked was that the counter has several laminated flip folders describing each of the featured brews.  I am still learning about craft beers, so I enjoy reading the details of each brew when available.

My only negative was that the brewery doesn't have flights of beer to sample.  Instead, they give free samples in small plastic cups.  In fact, you can try everything they have on tap!  But I found the samples too small (they said 3 oz, but they actually were only partly filled so about the size of a shot) to be able to distinguish the uniqueness of each brew, especially if you don't get a glass of water to clear the taste of the previous sample.  Of the four samples I tried, only the seasonal pumpkin ale stood out and the spices overwhelmed the beer and pumpkin flavors.    For me, I would prefer a legitimate four or five ounce sample to see how the flavors hold up to appreciate the nuance of each selection.  That's why I like the flights.  I don't want to buy a whole pint and find out that I may not like how the taste develops.  

I know the brewery makes good beer, so even though I was disappointed with my visit to the brewery/taproom, I don't need to see the awards to know this place will continue on the right path.  I simply wish they would add the option of flights like so many of the other breweries around town.

If you're eyeballing that $54 insulated steel growler and wondering ""Does it actually work?"" I can confirm that it does. We have kept beer (unopened) in the fridge for a month, transported the beer 4 hours without a cooler, and opened the growler to find perfect and COLD beer inside.

* High quality and consistency (gotta have this, of course).

* Distinctive house style. Bier beer is instantly recognizable. Their beer has a very fresh, lucid, clear, clean taste with all of the flavors distinct. Good balance, and the flavors pop in a certain way that is hard to describe. Try it and you'll see what I mean.

* A solid niche. Although Bier can do hoppy very well (their PDG pale ale is distinctive and a real favorite), that's not their focus. They do lagers, wheat beers, and less-hoppy ales with great skill, and they make them exciting and interesting as well. Yesterday I sampled their International Exchange lager and Good Pils (humble name, this!), and both were subtly incredible.

Beyond the beer, there are some other great reasons to visit:

* Friendly staff with a great vibe. They clearly are enjoying their work and are fans of their own brewery.

* Great, comfortable space. It's inviting and easygoing.

* Dogs welcome inside!

* They don't do flights, but you can sample all of the beers at the counter.

* Lots of live music and activities.

If you are a beer nut, Bier definitely belongs high on your list to try. If you are looking for a good place to hang out with friends and have a sip of brew that will please connoisseurs and average drinkers alike, I do believe you will be pleased.",4/12/2017 21:12

The tap room is huge, and the tasting bar is all the way in the back.  Unfortunately (or fortunately depending on your point-of-view) the bar is tiny and can only accomodate about 10 people at a time.  This is good in a way because you get personalized attention from whoever is pouring your beers.  They will go out of their way to describe each beer they have on tap.   And describe they must because they usually have a prodigious number available at the time.  I think they had at least 10 the last time I was there.

They have no ""house beers"", meaning that if you find one you especially enjoy, you better fill a growler or two because it may not be available the next time you come.  They do try to have certain styles available all the time (i.e. lager, ale, etc.)",11/11/2011 16:29

Comfy sofas are available to relax in, and vinyl records are abundant, just pick what you would like to hear and pop it on the record player! I really like that touch! This is a dog friendly place and the sweet mascot will greet you when you walk in.

I would never tell one of my customers something is expensive because it's something I don't HAVE to do for them.

In a city that is flooded with breweries trying to make their mark, I can always count on a Bier brew to be delicious.  As much as I enjoy downing a pint (or three) of their sudsy goodness at a local bar, it surprises me that it took me so long to make my way to their Tap Room.  Honestly I only stopped by because I was making a trip to their neighbor Great Fermentations and decided to head inside on a recent Friday night.

Their tap room is set up for groups of nearly any reasonable size.  Couples will find seating as easily as groups of 8.  They have several tables with mismatched chairs and couches.  In the corner they even have a spot for some live music which we got to enjoy during our visit.  

Head to the back right corner and tell the workers if you've never been, because they will be happy to help you sample and select a good brew.  Beers are served in plastic cups, which I think could definitely be upgraded at some point since it felt a little cheap to me (but hey, no dishes to wash!).  Follow the staff recommendations, because they want to make you happy and provide you with something new!

All in all I have to say that I would come back again!  One thing that was a tad disappointing is the turnaround time for a keg.

Now he has his own pico-brewery (I am not even sure it would qualify as a nano-brewery with his batch sizes, lol) yet he still loves talking about brewing with other homebrewers.  He still basically is one, his equipment just got a little bigger.  Darren and his crew have McGyvered the entire place.  He built the brewstand he uses, he built his own keg washer, he even engineered and built his own cooler rooms that you see.  The man has truly built the place from the ground up and considered every detail.

When I say he is a pico-brewer, I do not mean that disparagingly.  His super small batches of beer allow him to do things that most other brewers cannot due to scale.  He can control every detail.  He can make sure that everything that goes in is top quality.  His attention to detail and high level of skill shows through in his brews.  Even beer styles that I do not like I can try there and think ""Not my thing, but DAMN it is made well!""

Those small batches show his skill in other ways.  When you have tiny batches such as his, tiny errors show through in huge ways.  Multi-thousan gallon batches can hide errors.  When you brew less than a 100 gallons at a time even a few grams on some ingredients can make drastic changes.  The fact that he can consistently brew great beer in small quantities shows the skill of the brewers at Bier Brewery.

Bier Brewery is one of Indy's newer microbreweries situated on the outskirts of town, which is definitely worth the drive and visit. I stopped by about an hour before closing, which was more than enough time to chat with the servers, learn about the brewery and, of course, sample some product. Oh, and the samples (no pints) are free. Woo Hoo! 

Granted, they aren't the typical 3-4 oz., but if your goal (like mine) is to try a little of everything, they were the perfect sampling sizes for nine different pours. Most of the current brews were lighter in color and flavor with nothing on the dark side, although one of the girls told me they can and have brewed up to 100 different varieties and their tap list rotates constantly...what!? Very impressive.

After enjoying their current lineup, I walked around the relaxed tap room, decked out with couches and lounging chairs. Oh, and if you want further proof that Bier is about quality in addition to quantity, make sure you check out their wall of fame, covered in numerous awards and ribbons from various brewing competitions, including the Great American Beer Festival. 

Just like one of their self-proclaimed/named brews, PDG, this place is pretty damn good. 'Nuff said. 4.5 Stars.",2/16/2014 22:53

There were a few different beers to try (mint chocolate chip stout comes to mind...) and I would love to come back here and keep sampling, and also to fill a growler.

I normally stop in on a Friday, and they only let me sample three beers which I think is kind of lame. I also think their name is dumb, and also their slogan is terrible. They NEED better marketing. Whenever I tell someone I stopped by Bier Brewery, they ask me which one (because it just sounds like I stopped by a beer brewery), and then I have to spell their name... annoying! Also, their slogan is ""Come taste our awesomeness!"" This sounds like something an unoriginal frat bro would think of in three seconds, probably while smashed. You can do better!

I stopped in last Friday, and I brought in a couple growlers, and I tried three of their beers (only three due to their imposed limit). After sampling, the guy behind the bar asked ""Do you know what you'll be getting?"" It was that awkward moment where I had to reveal that I really didn't like the three samples I had, and would not be getting any. Why not ask ""What did you think?"" or ""Would you like a growler fill?"" Just a little annoying, because its not the first time this has happened. If they would have let me sample a few more, I probably would have gotten a growler fill, but I just didn't like the ones I tried.

This is my favorite brewery of all. They are a small batch brewery and usually do not distribute much in the city of Indy except 5-10 places and that too on and off.
However, their tasting room is absolutely worth a visit. Upon entering you are greeted by a friendly and knowledgeable staff who are more than willing to give you a sample of each of their many creations. Yes, i do call them creations because the way they experiment with beers can only be found in a very few other breweries.
I have been here multiple times to get my growler filled and always get beer from here when my friends are visiting.
I have always found 4-5 that are very good among the 6-10 that they usually sample and i have found out that i am not the only one.
If ever one day i open a brewery of my own i wish for it to be like this. The master brewer is there in person most of the time and the staff is the same.
Great beer and decent prices willing to fill your growlers between Wednesday and Sunday ranging from $10-$24(for the really special brews)

I had the chance to try them again at a fundraiser this weekend (did anyone pick up on the fact that they're giving back to the community all over the friggin' place? AWESOME! ... and thank you!).

The fact that they have no true ""house"" beers is a major draw. The sheer creativity and passion really shines through on each batch and makes being a local beer fan more exciting than ever. The anticipation from week to week is palpable.

Bier Brewery is just that, though - a tap room with limited seating, no food or other beers available. I'm OK with that - their beer makes up for all the rest. And many times they have food trucks out front to fill your belly with.

I love that they aren't located downtown like many of our other local breweries (but I'll be honest, I love it most because they're convenient for me).

You like dunkles? How about two different dunkles on draft, one made with rye? Will that work for you? How about a smoked brown, a Belgian pale, or a stout that was recently named the best in the state at a local competition? Oh, cream ale is your thing? Stop on in for a delicious brew that kicks the ass of that ""other"" cream ale in town.

As a homebrewer and overall beer enthusiast, Bier has become my place of worship.   I moved to Indy a few months ago and visited a few of the local establishment around town looking for a good ""fit"" - SunKing was cheap and plentiful, Fountain Square Brewing was progressive and unique, 3WiseMen was commercial and accessible, but Bier made me a believer.  

A few sips of the DFG, India Brown Ale, and Chinookalicious was all it took.  The taste, the freshness and the intoxicating aroma of hops were overwhelming.  Their brews are inspiring and experimental, but they never sway from their core values; small batches and quality ingredients.  I left my first visit to Bier with five growlers.  Now that I'm part of the Bier doctrine, I regularly visit on the weekends to make my offerings ($10-$16 per growler) and listen to their employees preach the word of good brew.

I can't give this place a full five stars, because it just doesn't have that atmosphere where you feel like you belong or fit in.

I should add a disclaimer; I rarely hang out at Bier. I like the people and the atmosphere, but the beer is just too good, and I'm afraid said delicious beer will cause me to drive back home drunk! So, I nearly always get growlers, bullets, and/or cans to go. The mix-and-match cans option is a huge plus because, like Central State and some other local breweries, Bier is good at having a mix of house favorites and new experimental beers in cans at any given time. Standouts include PDG (a perfect pale ale), their ESB (which is unfortunately getting harder and harder to get since it is so coveted), Sabbath (a black Kolsch), last year's Marzen (the best canned Marzen on the planet), their legendary pumpkin ale (the best I've ever had), and a variety of other Belgian-style ales (they don't do exclusively Belgians, I just happen to like Bier's take on Belgians). I haven't even had their most famous beer, Sanitarium, but that's partially because I don't like boozy, barrel-aged beers (and also because it sells out so fast). This is one of the best breweries in Indiana, and likely the whole midwest. No flights, but they'll let you taste until you find something you like (which won't take long if you are a beer lover). They are also really active in the community and do countless fundraisers. I'm down to my last month in Indy, and this will be one of the places I miss the most!

They keep some of the same types of staples (try the Weizengoot) and rotate in seasonal and special beers too.  We recently had the Pumpkin Ale and the Autumn Saison -- both really tasty.

The initial cost when purchasing your very own growler seems a bit steep, but just remember -- you can bring that dark, curvy, beautiful glass jug back in and fill it with 64oz of delicious liquid courage any time from that day forward... even on Sundays.  Heck -- especially on Sundays in Indiana. 

Rumor has it that they are closed on Mondays and Tuesdays and only offer pints on the weekends.  Maybe we are just lucky and always hit it on a day where pints are available?!?  Also have heard the food trucks are only available when pints are.  Hmmm... I need to buy a lottery ticket with my luck so far! 

A growler refill costs 12-14 bucks, depending on the variety (the Pumpkin is currently $14 while the staples are $12).  The only thing is -- you cannot drink from the growler on site.  They also offer a smaller glass to-go bottle called the ""Bullet"" (32oz) should 64oz seem a bit much.

Another bonus is that they have had a different food truck parked outside each time we have gone.  They have ranged from gourmet Mac-N-Cheese to Some Guys Pizza (the Greek was uhh-mazing), to comfort food (fried catfish, pulled pork).  A nice addition when the munchies strike and they don't mind if you bring it inside to enjoy with your pint.

There are comfy couches and a TV -- looks and feels like a little community living room in the middle.  There are also tables to sit at and the restrooms are clean.  You can even buy cute/funny TShirts should you choose.

My advice: 
1.  Get your complimentary samples when you arrive -- 3 per person or 6 samples total for 2 people -- so bring a friend and share the wealth.  
2.  Pick a pint to enjoy on site.  
3.  Take a growler to go.

They're located in a nondescript strip mall near the railroad tracks in a sleepy neighborhood off Allisonville Road. You could easily drive pass them. I almost did!

559,NZdONhH3XeFZauyV2yLiAQ,#NAME?,7clCBgNbd-x2Wj96lZ6Mjw,4,2,0,0,"This is based on my visit there about three weeks ago on a Friday evening. I had been here one other time, on a weekday afternoon, and I was the only person there. But my experience overall was consistent with my more recent visit.

Bier has been around a while. It started out pretty small and was basically available just on tap at a few restaurants around Indy and at their tasting room, which had very limited hours. Their having decided to can and distribute their beer has probably really helped, and they've slowly gotten a little bit bigger over time. 

I like their beer. I've never tasted anything by them that knocked my socks off, but their quality control is very good and they do a few creative things, especially now with the hazy IPA craze. But their stalwart staples such as Weizengoot (a hefeweizen that is my favorite of their beers) are very strong.

The taproom itself has a roped off area out front with some seating, and there's more seating inside, all tables socially distanced. There is a small counter area where you order. They have maybe 10 beers on tap at any one time, all theirs as far as I saw. They also have a carryout fridge. The folks at the counter were super friendly and wore masks at all times, particularly when cleaning tables between customers.

The taproom does not serve food but they welcome you to bring your own. I'm not sure about pets, as I didn't see any there. I'd imagine they'd at least be welcome on the patio area out front, weather permitting.

In the end, Bier is probably not going to be a splashy name in town like Sun King is and isn't going to demand that kind of attention. But their beer is quite good, and I think if they had more resources (or ambition? I don't think it's fair to judge on something I don't know for sure. Some craft breweries actually don't want to be big and notorious and prefer to stay smaller) they'd be one of the heavies in the state as far as the top breweries go.",11/18/2020 18:33

He has created his own beard oil, and it's very good.  He has 2 now out and they are worth checking out.

The oil is made from the best ingredients around, but for me the scent didn't last all day.  I don't have as long of a beard as Tommy's but for me it's what I want and like.   Still I like the oil and recommend it to others, just for my personal preference I like something that you can smell for longer then a few hours.

Multiple friends have requested them as gifts. I saw Darth Vader, Boba Fett, Chewbacca, and a Storm Trooper, available in silver or gold tone. 

Eh...I kinda thought the higher prices would be because the products were made in the USA. Many of the items I saw were made in China, but some are USA made...just not all. Definitely unique clothing, many Indiana-centric Ts, but not much that a corporate man could wear to work. Maybe perfect for a graphic designer or small-shop web developer, a photographer...someone in an artistic profession...but if you're an exec you may not find suitable pieces here. 

Grooming and ""gift"" stuff is also in stock. 

You can definitely tell the owner has stocked this store with things that fit his own sense of style. I hope the business makes it but I think it needs to appeal to a wider audience. I'm not saying ""be generic,"" I'm just saying stock clothing that isn't just for hipsters. When a shirt has a $100 price tag, it probably needs to be suitable for someone who can afford it. Maybe I'm the only one who feels this way, but paying $100 for a shirt ""made in China"" (like everything at Old Navy) doesn't sit well with me.

Seriously, if I had some serious cash in the bank, I'd purchase nearly every item in this store...if the size would fit my small body type. 

Honestly, this place is exactly what I'd like my apartment to look like. Woodsy, rustic, with a touch of urban. It appeals to the eyes, but even more the other senses, especially smell. The smells inside the store and the other products are my type of body products, spot on.

The biggest concern about the store is the price tag on most items. But, look at the quality and where it comes from and you can reason the price tag for a nice ""treat yourself"" moment every now and then. 

I particularly loved looking through the tons and tons of items throughout the store - body products, cologne, hair and beard grooming, clothes, shoes, bikes and gear, and the list goes on and on. 

If you're in the area, make the trip and give it a shot. They have a nice ""Sales"" section too if you don't want to break the bank on some of the other expensive items. Even if you're not in the area, stop on over. You won't regret it!",9/14/2018 15:51

One of my favorite growth spurts has been in Irvington.  Little by little, businesses are starting and in this area there are several artists, designers, and photographers.  This men's store is one of those places.

It appeals to the urban hipster look.  Men with beards and buns.  It has some great products and the gentleman's jewelry section is very elaborate.

The only thing I didn't like was that the owner was on his phone the while time and didn't look up to say hello or ask if I needed help or anything,  When its a big business I expect this, but a small, locally owned one, I want it to feel more personable.",2/3/2016 18:35

I'd been seeking a particular Oscar de la Renta skirt but it had sold out online.  Calls to my local SF store found the salesperson telling me ""computer says I have one, so if I run across it, I'll let you know"".... which everyone knows is the blow off....& I wasn't going to go all the way down there if she wouldn't even confirm if they had it or not

Calls to NY were even worse, as the salesperson wouldn't even let me get my sentence finished before she says ""Forget it. We sold out of that long ago"". Umm, okay.....

So being the stubborn person I am, I cold-called this location & Christine answered the phone.  Turns out that this Saks doesn't even carry Oscar but she stated she would do everything in her power to find this skirt for me

She phoned me back a couple of hours later saying there was 1 skirt left in their entire company & she may have found it but wasn't sure it was still in that particular store....but again assured me she would do everything she could to make sure it was delivered to me

This morning, I got confirmation it has just been shipped.......from my very own local SF store, where the salesperson couldn't be bothered to check her stock

So after being blown off by 2 Saks stores, I had lost all hope.  But thanks to Christine ( who went above and beyond to provide exemplary customer service, and especially for a store who didn't even carry the brand ) I got the item I was seeking.  I thank you & thank this particular Saks location for ensuring my Oscar dreams!!",12/31/2014 18:37

My mom had run out of the makeup she uses.  As a result, the next stop on Mom's retail therapy trip that the wife and I were taking her on was Saks Fifth Avenue.  Apparently my mom has been using the same Estee Lauder stuff for decades.   I'm clueless about women's makeup and the latest technology, but according to the wife, she needed to find something that suited her better.  Saks had the full complement of cosmetic options to choose from, to include her usual Estee Lauder products.  Enter Erin, the friendly salesperson working the Armani counter, who approached us and asked if she could assist us.  She was very patient and reassuring with my mom.  She listened to what she wanted to achieve with her makeup, and then proceeded to recommend some products and apply makeup on her.  Mom, somewhat hesitant of change, seemed happy with the results.  We bought the makeup and some brushes to apply and left for home.  What made the trip to Saks a 5-star experience was that when we got home, my dad, without any prompting, complimented Mom on her appearance, which made her happy and visibly lifted her spirits.  For that, it was worth all of the time and effort dragging my mom through countless stores on a Friday afternoon.",8/15/2014 10:49

About two months ago, I went upstairs to browse dresses and women's work suits and was confronted by one of the rudest employees I've ever met. I didn't catch her name because of trying to social distance (and she didn't introduce herself) but it was an older blonde woman with a thick accent. She kept following me around, everywhere I went, not in a helpful or friendly way, but in an ""I've got my eyes on you"" way. It was so embarrassing. She eventually came straight up to me (disregarding social distancing), grabbed the clothes out of my hands, and announced they would be in a dressing room. Didn't ask me, didn't slowly approach me, didn't even tell me where she was taking them. I then went to go find this dressing room, and she got angry that I didn't know where it was at. Um, sorry? Then, the whole time I was trying stuff on, she was standing right outside the door, rushing me along. It was so rude that I just gave up and left. I handed over all my clothes minus a package of hoosiery because I needed some. Before I purchased them, I wanted to look at perfume, and she followed me to the escalator and ripped them out of my hands screaming, ""What are you doing?!?"" It scared the crap out of me. She scolded me that I wasn't allowed to look at anything else until I bought my hoosiery first, I wasn't allowed to carry it around, and how dare I try to walk away with it. In front of strangers, she treated me like a criminal as if I was trying to steal something. Which makes no sense, especially because I was dressed extremely well, just had my hair done, wearing my diamond jewelry, AND in a close-fitting dress complete with a tiny purse. Where the heck would I have put it? She left me in tears. I've encountered plenty of not-so-friendy employees here at Saks, but this horrible woman takes first place for being the most disrespectful. What's worse is that I called the office to tell them of my experience - they weren't there, so I left a voicemail - and they never returned my call or got back with me. So the problem appears to work up its way to management as well, they simply didn't care. I have no problem spending good money on high-quality clothes, I work hard and need nice work suits. I literally just got my graduate degree and am a young professional. This was a despicable experience, both management and this particular employee should be ashamed of themselves for how they treated a quiet, well-mannered guest just trying to buy some business attire.",10/8/2020 2:22

I didn't need anything but I had a Saks gift card gift & tried to order an item online.  The website wasn't working so I called their help number & ordered through them.  They didn't enter my gift card properly & it wasn't credited.  
SEVEN LONG phone calls & 5 months later it still isn't resolved.  Every time I called I got someone with a different strong accent and often a dog barking.

When you want to communicate that you have enough money to buy a $390 Balenciaga ""dad hat"" that is obviously cheap as dirt to make (I've ordered better made logo hats for around $8, so that's a 4875% markup), this is your place.

Sometimes you pay for quality, but sometimes you just pay. I've heard that the intrinsic value and satisfaction that people associate with an item goes up the more they pay for it, and you can certainly test that theory here. But frankly, that dad hat just made me laugh out loud at the audacity of it all. It takes some serious gumption to overcharge that outrageously.

Still, there's a place for peacocking to show your social status, I suppose. No one will try to run you out of the store if it's obvious you choose to make more practical shopping choices and are just a shopping tourist, but don't expect friendly service either. Aloof is about the best you can expect from the staff here. But to be honest I would rather shop without people fawning all over me, so that suits me just fine.

Frankly, I don't really have to try to be unimpressed at the best of the brands available here, but I'm a practical Midwestern girl that chooses to spend her money on different things, so I'm not exactly the target market. It is true that people are judged by strangers partly on what they wear, but that little fact cuts both ways. If I ever see anyone in that Balenciaga hat I'm going to judge the heck out of them, and not in a good way.

If you're looking for Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Fendi, Balenciaga, Chanel, Rag n Bone etc. this is pretty much the only game in town. The perfumes and colognes are unusual and worth a stop if you want to find a signature scent that not everyone has encountered before. Just don't expect the salespeople to know much about scents, so you'll be finding that scent on your own. I have the feeling most people just come in here for a label then leave.",12/21/2018 10:49

Very unprofessional, she went out of her way to make me feel unwelcome. 

This is not my first experience with inconsiderate workers here, either, I think management makes a goal to take advantage of customers and hire extremely high-pressure sales people. I get it's a corporation/big retail store, but there's a way to do it nicely and with respect.

His name is Jason and he works in men's cologne. It makes ALL the difference in the world when someone goes out of their way to be kind. You'll remember it, you shop with them again and you'll make sure you refer them to everyone you know.

I was showing my young son different types of men's scents and I wanted to get a sense of what he liked. Jason took notice and came over and offered some help. My son was shocked at how much cologne costs but Jason was happy to have him smell and try out some scents. 

It was truly an eye opener for my son to see that cologne can cost $800 or more for a few ounces. So when I asked Jaxon if he wanted to make a purchase (he really liked Tom Ford's F**kin'  Fabulous) he said he couldn't afford it... lol He's 10 years old.

After trying a few scents I asked Jason if my son could have a sample and he gave a son a NICE size sample of the one he loved! I was NOT expecting that. That made my son's entire day.

My son now treasures it because he knows how expensive it is so he keeps it close. 

Thank you Jason for being so nice, thoughtful and generous with your time. Me trying to expose my son to colognes turned into him actually getting a nice scent that he loves. I'm sure he'll remember the experience and you now have a customer!

I'm hard of hearing & learning ASL. Today was what I call an ""immersion day""; little to no being verbal & using ASL as much as possible (given my somewhat limited vocabulary). I was greeted by a nice young lady & pointed to the area I thought was a dressing room.  She suggested another area, said to follow her & took the items I wanted to try on.  I signed ""thank you"" to her & was amazed to have her sign back to me! Not just mimic ""thank you"" back to me in that awkward way those unfamiliar with ASL do to try to engage (which I think is nice of them to try) . I believe this young lady's name was Emma (she finger spelled her name quickly but I think I caught it correctly). I've had ""immersion days"" before & this was the first time my ASL was reciprocated! I left right at closing time & was greeted by the security guard.  He inquired if the door I was heading for wad the one I needed.  I pointed to my ear & he spoke louder so I could hear better.  I nodded yes & he said he'd unlock it for me. I signed ""thank you"" to him as well.  He signed it back to me & wished me a good night. Normally I feel left out in public because of my hearing but today's experience made me feel accepted & welcome.

It's a fun little game to guess the prices of clothes here.  Having been a seamstress I know that the quality isn't always up to par with the prices they are asking (which is why I'm not very good at this particular game - though it's fun to play).

In another universe I have a double-stroller, I drive a BMW SUV and it's loaded with shoe boxes, and garment bags. Instead, for now, I Yelp. 

A good note for guys that feel entirely discomfit in the perfume/make-up departments of places like this: need not bring your latest copy of The Economist because they were able to decode my inquiry of which I didn't know the full name of what I needed to buy. It was pre-wrapped as a gift, and the entire bumbling transaction was finished within 3 minutes. 

As for the Men's section of clothes & shoes....I have more shoes, and that's not saying much. There's maybe a dozen shoe options here? All priced $98 and higher. That's really no fun. Come onnnnnn, we men need our shoe shoppin' therapy, too!

O, okay, no shoes, well, clothes will do...oh, wait, the racks here make it seem like a boutique because of such limited supply. The problem is...it's a department store through & through, so the intimate setting of a boutique isn't here...it just seems like a picked through section stuck between Chicago's Saks & Bloomington's Urban Outfitters. 

Maybe I just looked like I knew what I was doing...but no one asked to help me...instead they were re-arranging the Men's Suit section -- if you're wondering...it takes 3 Saks employees to do it. 

I'll return, yes, with the simple hope that somehow something interesting jumps off the Saks truck on its way to Chicago.

The ice cream was just what I expected ""OK"", but seeing as I'm a real fan of Froyo you can take that with a grain of salt.

The real issue here is the service, I went specifically for the National Ice Cream deal and not only did the cashier who helped us have no prior knowledge of this deal she didn't try to act as if she cared about being ignorant in her job. I've been teaching my niece the value of money and letting her interact with the cashiers at the different places we go and since the cashier had no idea about the BOGO deal my niece couldn't ""afford"" hers.

Let me start by saying that I love COLD STONE CREAMERY as a whole.  If you live on Indy's west side, drive to the Plainfield store at Metropolis or register your birthday complimentary desert there.

The Avon location had its' day in the sun, but just like on any hot day, the ice cream melts fast and so did this locations opportunity to keep me coming back.  When the location first opened, you got the royal treatment and fan-fare of a flagship franchise Cold Stone Creamery.  The employees sang out the Cold Stone songs and pleasantries, the orders were quick and accurate, and you felt like visiting time and time again.

Nowadays, the owner/operator greets you with ""What you want"" and before I could even order, he says, ""No coupons here"".   I happened to have the latest Entertainment Book in hand and was looking to use one coupon and walk out of the store with 5 different orders for the family.  I only planned to use the one coupon for one order as it stated, but he simply refused entertaining the Entertainment Book offering.  I placed my order, but it left an impression.

I went back several other times afterward with the same parting feelings of ""what is this guys problem"" for a myriad of other reasons not even relating to discounts or coupons.  I guess some people think they can run a franchise by name alone with little to no people skills.  I would recommend the Plainfield location as they are always pleasant and friendly.",1/2/2012 8:57

This shop was clean, had plenty of free parking in the shared lot, and it looked like the ice cream tubs/barrels on display were maintained and full.  (I hate looking through a long list of options only to find out the place is out of my first choice!)  

The ice cream is fairly rich tasting and the flavors seem true to the description.  Not the cheapest place around, but that's okay as long as the quality is good and the wait isn't too long.

Went on a weekday about 8pm - there were two dudes ahead of me (strange bachelor run for ice cream I guess). The girl working was friendly but obviously stressed out by the line of people. I didn't mind the wait, but was irritated that the coworker in the back room didn't come out to assist the poor girl. 

About 7 minutes later she was ready for my order. There was an advertisement for a s'mores concoction that sounded appetizing so I told her to make that. She was smashing the crap out of those toppings - by the time it got in my cup is was a blended, mushy, runny mess. It reminded me if something I'd do when I was like 8yrs old with vanilla ice cream and Hershey's chocolate sauce. Not pretty looking at all.

OK - so I overlook the fugly presentation and start diving into my treat. Way too much chocolate and no marshmallow what-so-ever. It tasted like it looked, a hot mess of ice cream and chocolate with a few bits of graham cracker as an after thought.

You also get a discounted rate on many of their other health services.

I'm not talking about the latest and greatest highly marketed items, but those kinds of things I grew up liking or buying for my kids when they were growing up.  

They had Star Wars, Star Trek, GI Joe, Marvel and DC figures, Barbies, sports figures, and so much more.  Lots of vintage comic books too.

I've been to comic stores and to a somewhat similar place in Fishers, but this shop, though packed, seems more organized and easier to get around in.  There were lots of items I remember seeing 20-30 years ago.  Some were still in the packaging, but there were some just in plastic bags that were really affordable if you are looking for toys that kids can play with.  (Why pay for the packaging?)

But they had some items that, although maybe not in mint condition, were unique.  How about a life sized inflatable Jabba the Hut!  Or helmets of storm troopers or Boba Fett.  Ora cooler that looks like R2D2.  Yes, they had them!

The guys who work there were friendly and easy to talk to about the items.  Although I didn't make any purchases this day, I got some ideas I may pass along to my family for my birthday/Christmas.  Fun stuff!

Note that this location is a little awkward to get to from the south.  I highly recommend cutting across Troy to Brill Street and then heading north from there because Madison angles and would be difficult to turn onto Brill from the south.  Southbound on Madison is no problem though...just watch for the street sign.

The pharmacy definitely has its issues and they tend to never know what is going on but I blame that to high turnover. I honestly have never seen the same pharmacist there twice. They all probably run as soon as they can due to the clientele coming in.

Not sure I can say much besides if you just have to stop in and get something it is good. The pharmacy would not be my first choice if I had a CVS closer to me or I was not so lazy to just switch to something different.

It is conveniently located on the south side of Washington Street (a turn lane is there for anyone who has to cross traffic.)

I used to drive by this when I lived on the east side and drove local streets to downtown.  I wasn't impressed.  But in the time between my last visit and now, the park has undergone a half million dollar makeover (Wow!) that has made it a go to place.

  Do you want a place with shade and a shelter with picnic tables, quiet places with benches to relax, open space for activities on the far east end?  They got it here!  Do you want basketball courts, an aquatic center, and a cool playground right near the shelter?  They got it!

The park has a lot of paths (grit based) to travel on your way to the different amenities.  The playground and aquatic center (pool, slides, splash pad) are separated by the common parking lot so that the end of the lot fill faster than the center.

  Note:  There is also a memorial to Sylvia Likens on the southwest edge of the park.  If you are interested in learning more about the memorial, there is a great review by Richard P that has all the information you would like under the Sylvia Likens heading.

685,0LG94Y6IuciIIU_iISEoEA,A9cXP_K95FRor1qxuUEu2g,xAAhPuZ8FG6OlvAw5m1BVQ,4,3,0,2,"In my early days of independence as a young, disabled adult post-high school, I found myself living on the Near-Eastside of Indy in a recently renovated old school turned apartment building at 1417 East Ohio Street. I didn't live in the building very long, to be honest, because I struggled in those early years to acquire the independent living skills necessary to succeed. However, I fell in love with this side of town. It's where I met my wife and it's where I also met the very last person I dated not so long ago. 

Yeah, this side of town has lingered in my life despite my having not lived in it for years. 

Willard Park is a Near-Eastside gem. Named after the founder of the Indiana School for the Deaf, Willard Park actually was the location of the original Indiana School for the Deaf in 1850. Now, it's an 11-acre park that used to be more known for the nearby prostitutes and run-down housing than as a place where children and families could truly relax, enjoy some recreation, and have a genuinely good time. 

After a $500,000 grant allowed for some significant upgrades, it seems like the entire area really followed suit. While it's still a fairly low-income area, it's a low-income area with a strong sense of community and pride and one that continues to be on the upswing with area businesses like The Neidhammer and Ash & Elm Cider joining others in contributing to the neighborhood's consistent improvement. 

Willard Park offers park benches under shade trees, an outdoor pool, a large picnic shelter, a soccer field, and playground equipment that is a source of pride in the neighborhood. There's also a nice trail that goes around the fairly small park - it's easily wheelchair friendly and the sidewalk that surrounds the large parking lot has multiple curb cuts with the pool area being the most obvious point of entry. 

The park is right next to a fire station, which adds to the safe feeling that now dominates the park. Additionally, there's the adjacent Sylvia Likens Memorial donated by the late Indiana filmmaker Ivan Rogers that honors the memory of 16-year-old Sylvia Likens, who was murdered in one of Indiana's most tragic and unforgettable tales. While the sidewalk does not go up to the memorial, the ground is fairly even and even being in a wheelchair myself I've never had difficulty reaching it. 

Willard Park isn't Indy's most extravagant park. It doesn't offer all the luxuries. While there's a crosswalk from the neighborhood to the park across what can be a busy East Washington Street, I do wish the neighborhood park felt more accessible to the neighborhood. However, it's a beautiful park made more beautiful by recent upgrades and practically defines what it means to be a neighborhood park. 

I remember living in the area and making jokes about Willard Park. There's nothing to joke about now - it's a little gem in a little gem of a neighborhood.",2/23/2019 16:31

The park is the site of that school. Willard park is an accessible park. It has one of the largest covered pavilions I have seen at a neighborhood park.  There is a free private lot, a playground, a walking/running trail, a full basketball court, a half basket court, and an aquatic center.  It is not very quiet as it is right by a firehouse and located off of a busy street.

The playground is accessible to children with disabilities. There is a long ram that leads up to the top of the jungle gym equipment.  It is some older looking equipment that could use some TLC. Kids will still find it entertaining. The pavilion is massive and has picnic tables. The basketball courts are nice for the most part. The full court has a few cracks, tons of trash, some graffiti. It needs a resurfacing.  The half court was a bit lower than the standard height (not complaining) and was in better shape than the full court. It also has 2 4-square courts on the end opposite the hoop.

The trail is unpaved but pretty wide. Not sure how far it is, but it looked like a quarter to a half mile or so.

The park has a lot of space. It spans over 11 acres. It also has lots of trash. I even saw a spot where someone dumped burned charcoal from their grill. There was a city worker there picking up trash when I was there, but they needed a team to tackle that job.

The park has a memorial for Sylvia Likens in the back near the fence, a young girl that was tortured and murdered by her caregiver.

This is a decent park, even though it is slipping a bit.  It has lots of potential and can easily be a five star spot.",3/8/2021 22:47

It is really located in a nice area where other businesses are located, like oking at the outside of the building you wouldn't think it was big but it was a nice size place once you stepped inside. They have a bar area, chairs, tables and a stage. On Sunday's they only offer brunch which is a nice selection of breakfast food. They also have comedy and said coming up they will have gospel music. It's really a nice place to go right after church for a meal and to laugh or for a concert. 
From the menu I picked Keep It Simple Brunch Menu which consisted of 2 scrambled eggs, 2 pieces of bacon which u could choose pork or turkey, hash brown casserole, one pancake, one biscuit and sausage gravy which you could also choose pork or sausage. 
The food....the eggs...I must say when I go out I never get scrambled I only get over medium but was told he only fixed them scrambled and I was surprised how good they were...they were soft and creamy to be an egg, the hash brown casserole was good with nice size shreds of potatoes, cheese and just enough onion to taste, the biscuit was good and soft, the sausage gravy was good and tasty and had a lot of sausage in it...the bacon was that good ole kountry bacon which 4 of us asked the waitress if she could take our bacon back and zap it in the microwave because we all liked our bacon cooked crisp..it was not a problem and she was very nice about it, the pancake was ok...I felt it was not a homemade pancake but it was ok, would have been nice just to have some butter on the pancake and the biscuit, and the syrup heated. 
They have many beverages to chose from coffee, tea, soda and even serve liquor. They had mimosas for the Sunday brunch. Overall it is a very nice place for you and your family to go.

It's a great location downtown; you cant see it from the road but you just go into the building and its right there on the first floor! First off, I loved the design of the salon: very modern and trendy, so I was comfortable with that. Normally, I am skeptical with trying new salons/stylists, but Tabby did such a great job with my hair! I have had problems with other stylists not being able to achieve the look that I want, but Tabby was great! She's so sweet and she knew exactly the look I was going for. Needless to say, after 3 hours, my hair looked just like the pictures on pinterest I showed her. Would for sure recommend if you're looking to get ombre or balayage.

This salon is beautiful, and there's a lot of windows so natural light makes it a great experience! The view of downtown is great too! I was offered a water/tea/coffee when I arrived which was as nice touch. 

I'm very pleased with my hair since Belinda gave me a ton of options since I wasn't sure what I really wanted to do. Is it more pricey than other places I've been?

I have been going to my (excellent) stylist at MDG for probably fifteen years or so, so an update is appreciated, but this may be a bit over-designed for me.  I miss having the TV set to the news when I come in.  Now it's showing fashion shows or product-pushing.  I get that they're trying to create a certain atmosphere, but as a guy, there's a limit to how much atmosphere I need when I'm getting my hair cut.

One aspect of this that really chaps me is the desire to be ""exclusive,"" meaning that every so often they seem to drop product lines if someone else starts carrying them.  This means that, as a customer, if I become used to using a product, my stylist can no longer use the product or get the product for me and I have to find it elsewhere, or else switch to another one that they carry.  This sucks for me, obviously, but also sucks for my stylist because it prevents them from providing a reliable and consistent customer experience.  And consider I just spent $20 on product at another salon because I can no longer get the (locally-made) Kenra line there.  

This exclusivity may ultimately come at a cost to some of your less-well-situated customers who have to justify the expense of all this atmosphere.",1/4/2013 16:46

When she was doing my hair, she took the color up all the way to my roots, resulting in what my 50 year old male boss referred to as ""stripes."" She put me under heat and didn't bother to put the rest of my hair up so that it would be exposed to the heat. My hair was SO blonde and stripey at the top of my head and the ends of my hair stayed untouched and dark. Literally the exact opposite of what I asked for. I paid $290 for this plus a trim. 

But don't worry, I had this tragic mess fixed within a week by someone else at a different salon. I didn't trust the MDG stylist to know how to fix it and to top it off, the girl who fixed it was cheaper and did exactly what I wanted.

I was dying my hair a silver/white/gray and thought I should give in and pay the money for a professional if I had to bleach my entire head. That was defiantly a mistake. I left with my hair being the exact same brown color with charcoal tones for $70 + tip. We did the first round of color and it was too light, the ends were almost translucent looking. So she suggested going one shade darker and when I saw myself in the mirror, after rinsing the color out, my heart sank. ""WHERE DID THE GRAY GO??"", was my first thought. I expressed how frustrating the situation was and how disappointed I was to have damaged my hair so much for such a lackluster result. I got $10 off and the option to come back two weeks later and pay $100+ to have it redone. Are you kidding me?! I kept the appointment anyway thinking we could add lighter highlights to give it dimension. After deciding that I could do a better job at home I told her I needed to cancel the appt. I said I would love for her to maintain it after I find the right shade (as she's super personable and friendly). I also asked advice for who she would recommend to cut my hair there. No reply! Never heard from her again. Not only does it damage her own reputation it causes a loss of business for the salon. I would have LOVED to make this a regular place. 
It seems that lack of communication is a common theme as Chelly, who is in training, gave me her number and offered to give me a haircut on a Wednesday evening. No reply from her either when I tried to book..

It's nice to have another option in the area, that isn't Sakura or H20, and who doesn't love a restaurant where their ""mascot"" is an octopus dressed as a hibachi chef?

The decor reminded me of something out of a Sims game - black, red and futuristic, a refreshing style for a city that is often full of stale interior design for restaurants. Lots of fancy LED lighting and a bit of tacky fish oriented decorations too, but, it's nice and comfortable and contemporary.  Even the music playing over the loud speaker was downtempo, providing a ""big city"" feel to the establishment.

We were greeted instantly, and seated in the dining area, being that we were here for sushi and not hibachi. All the hibachi tables were being used though, either by groups or couples.  They also have a larger hibachi in a private area for large groups.

My friend had some spicy rolls and really enjoyed them. The presentation was clean and crisp. I had some sashimi and the fish was fresh, generous and delicious. I went to Sakura two days later alone, and the nigiri tasted fishy, when the salmon I had at Tomo was fresh and sweet, as salmon should be. 

I also had the shrimp tempura appetizer which featured two very large prawns (biggest I've had in the city!) and a nice mix of veggies. They were tasty as well. 

The service was a bit slow, but, needs were met when requests were made. They also have a somewhat vast (for Japanese) wine list and they make fancy cocktails such as mai tai's. I look forward to trying their hibachi and furthering my menu experience, glad to have Tomo here!",1/9/2010 21:13

Great seaweed salad - one of my test plates at any Japanese restaurant.

Also, while the sushi isn't the best in town, the presentation of the sushi can not be topped. Each plate is designed. The sushi isn't just stuck on there, it's thought out and presented artistically with an array of sauces used more like paint. The Perfect roll, is perfect. The Rock n' Roll is a interesting look and worth trying. And I have found many other rolls equally as satisfying.

One thing that stuck out is that the chef added a heap of the Yum Yum (white) sauce into the fried rice. That was bothersome because I'm not a big fan of it. Now I know to request that it not be added for next time.

Tomo Japanese Steak House & Sushi Bar features an urban space equal to what you might encounter off a main thoroughfare in the heart of Tokyo, or a hip NYC 'hood.  Tucked into a special section of the restaurant, the hibachi (also known as teppanyaki) grills are bounded by dark glittering granite table surrounds, modern yet comfortable seating, subtle splashes of blue lighting, wrapped with distinctive architectural details on the walls. If just for the décor, go once! 
The sushi was quite tasty and the presentation was top notch--absolutely, a work of art! It's the safe bet if you do go to check out the décor. And they offer half price sushi on Sunday afternoons, if you're still on the fence. Unfortunately, I cannot offer compliments on the teppanyaki. I gave some advice to the chef, but who knows if he really took it to heart or if I just visited on an off-day? Unlike the average Indy diner, I do not descend from a line of deer who might subsist on a salt-lick alone. I abhor overly salty food and rarely ever add it to my own cooking. How the hell an Asian joint (uh, isn't soy sauce the first ingredient of pretty much any teppanyaki dish??) came up with a bland fried rice that tasted saltless remains a mystery. The chef conceded that perhaps he'd used the sweet butter, rather than salty. If that got sorted out, I'd be willing to give it one more try. Plenty of great restaurants stumble a bit in the beginning. Before you commit to the teppanyaki, see if they'll let you sample their two dipping sauces which were also inferior to every other teppanyaki place I've ever eaten. I gave the chef feedback on that also and he said he was refining it. If that dipping sauce has been fixed, you might be brazen and give the grill a chance.",11/15/2009 23:50

I had a difficult argument with my significant other regarding dinner on the night that we visited Tomo. She wanted to go somewhere else for sushi, and I wanted to come to Tomo. NOW the reason for me wanting Tomo was that on average, Tomo had better reviews than this other place on Yelp. Her argument was that one of her closest friends had just had a terrible experience. Needless to say, since I'm writing a review for it, she conceded, and we were on our way. There were only a few key points about Tomo that really stick in my mind. We waited a long time after arriving to have our order taken, and by the time our waitress came to take our drink order, we were ready for food. Not a big deal. All of the wait staff seemed super busy, which makes sense since it was a crowded night, but maybe they could have had a few more people in there? Still, not a huge deal, but worth mentioning. When our food came, it was absolutely delicious and we weren't disappointed at all. We ordered quite a variety of sushi and each one was unique and tasty, and all of the flavors meshed very well together. The presentation was very good with all of the sushi displayed nicely on a big white (albeit a little bit dirty) plate, with the typical ginger and wasabi (which was very spicy!) garnishes.

The one detractor from the night was the cold, cold air that kept blowing in on us every time somebody opened the door. I know it's not something they have a lot of control over, so I will only leave this as a recommendation: if you go there on a cold night - sit as far away from the door as possible!

We ate in the room without the hot tables, selected sushi both a-la-cart and from the menu.  Ordered Sake and waited for the verdict.  The Sake, Momofoko Pearl (unfiltered) was a treat.  But the sushi stole the show.  First rate presentation, very fresh, beautiful, artful, luscious and....delicious.  There are ample cooked fish dished on the sushi menu, so don't be afraid to try.  The Lobster Tempura Roll is highly recommended.  Our son had the hibachi steak (and we did not need to sit through the show) he loved it.  My mother had the Rocky Shrimp app. as it was highly recommended on Yelp.  Nice generous pours of wine followed the sake.  All in all a wonderful experience.",10/25/2010 15:34

I have been here a total of three times and enjoyed myself each time. Among the basic rolls my favorite was the Spicy Scallop roll. The specialty rolls are beautifully plated and presented but sometimes leave you wondering a little bit. The Rock Star roll looks impressive but the overwhelming amount of tobiko isn't edible and is just left on the plate. I keep coming back for the Full Moon roll, which is a delicious combination of asparagus, kiwi, and sweet potato. Also, sushi places seem to be in competition to see who produce the most over-the-top Spider Roll, and Tomo's just might be the winner.",9/6/2011 19:32

The hibachi was also very flavorful iv had a lot of hibachi and this was the first that offered calamari. I asked for extra fried rice and they doubled it giving me a huge mound to conquer I was very excited. The food was great and the pricing was fair pretty average for Japanese steakhouses. The only down fall was our chef was not into it at all he wasn't enthusiastic and he seemed angry to be there but it won't deter me from going back all around great experience.,10/2/2014 16:23

It was the special of the day and it was a mango margarita. I will admit with no shame that I am a cocktail snob.  Especially when it comes to margaritas. I hate anything that tastes sugary and kool-aid like, and everyone else should too. The mango margarita delivered. It tasted so fresh and delicious! And it was huge! And they were very generous with the tequila, which is always my favorite surprise when I order a beverage somewhere. We ordered a bowl of soup, 4 sushi rolls, the boyfriend had 2 or 3 beers, and I had a giant marg all for under $70. So, great sushi, great service, great price, and best of all great cocktails.

The good: Great service, good food, and very reasonable prices. We were seated and served promptly. Portion sizes were good too.

The bad: Just not 5-star quality sushi. I've had much better fish, but that doesn't mean it's bad. Still a great restaurant with good service and food. The atmosphere could have been a little bit better. Food took a while considering we were one of the only groups there.

We look forward to trying another hibachi place and being able to compare the two, but as it stands, we will be returning.",4/30/2014 19:16

I'd read the reviews for Tomo and figured it was worth a shot.  It was a VERY sunny spring day so when we walked into the extremely dark dining room as was literally afraid I might fall on the way to our table.  Why so dark?  I get the impression this place has a clubby feel later in the evening?

I need to say that our server was the best.  She was so sweet to my daughter, touching her shoulder when she talked to her and paying her a lot of special attention.  In general the service was spot on.  I must have been asked a minimum of 20 times whether I'd like more iced tea.  Okay, a little annoying (NO I don't want more tea) but thoughtful.

My princess ordered edamame and a California roll.  I ordered the mackerel and some crazy souped up roll.  Everything was really good except for my roll.  It was way over sauced and just really over the top.  I'll take the blame for that though, I should have known better and stuck to sushi.

We'll definitely visit again...on  a cloudy day!",4/25/2013 14:35

I had lived in Indy for probably 7 years before I had some people invite me to eat there, when I only lived a couple of miles away.   It really is a shame since they do such a fantastic job with their hibachi AND sushi.  The preparation of their food definitely has much more consideration than the marketing of their restuarant.  The hibachi is always fun, as it should be, and the quality of steak and chicken is very good.   The Mango Lobster roll and Full Moon roll are my favorites and are presented in such a way that you can't believe you aren't at an expensive sushi restaurant.

The salmon teriyaki was less then a half inch thick and deep fried and dry The menu stated fresh fruit. Which was replaced with low quality deep fried egg roll and a sugar flavored cream cheese pouch. The California roll was mostly cucumber. 

We ordered 3 sushi rolls. The spicy yellowtail they filled with tempura crumbs,  so you weren't even getting fish. The tuna with avocado was nice so one  star for that, but it was the lowest quality tuna

Gyoza was yummy.  It came six to an order which is great because there were two of us. It seems like most places do 5.

Attempted it once and it was closed on a Sat at 7:30.  No sign saying why.  Then more recently, we were successfully able to eat here this past Friday.  :)  My gf called and made reservation for 6 adults and 3 kids.  Well, they set us up for 9 big chairs.  I asked for high chairs and they didn't have any available.  I have a 2 yr old.  He is high energy and does not know what walking means.  He is either running or sleeping.  No other choices here.  Anyways, as I learn this news, while struggling to hang onto my child, I decided I'll wait until one frees up.  Most of our party finally arrived and we got seated.  No menu or anything...just left us at our table.  :(  We were only missing one adult and one child.  Really?  I'm like...um no...can I please just order food for my child now.  It is his dinner time.  Finally someone heard me complain and brought menus and came by to get our drinks.  Also, a high chair was found for me!  YAY!  

Food:  Spicy shrimp tempura - so good.  The sauce is what did it for me.
side order of fried rice for my kid - he loved it.  Came piping hot.
SUSHI:  Spider roll, Eel tempura roll, tako - all the pieces were so huge!  Huge tako ( octopus on my rice) Huge crab in the spider rolls, and huge roll in general for the rolls.  Like too huge.  Took me 3 bites to finish it instead of the usual one.  :(  Sad because roll falls apart when you can't get it all in one bite.  Another sad bit, anyone at our table ordering sushi had to wait forever to get it.  They apparently only had one sushi chef that night.  :(  We were seated near him and could see he was really kicking ass trying to meet demands and failing badly seeing as a lot of people were waiting too.

Modern decor with the open black-painted ceiling. Four types of seating arrangements: tepanyaki grills, tables (for 2 and for 4), sushi bar, and regular bar. 2 TV's in the main dining area. 6 hibachi/tepanyaki grills.

I haven't tried the tepanyaki grills yet, just the sushi/sashimi samplers. The sushi and sashimi was very fresh and tender, high quality cuts of fish. I was impressed.

My sashimi sampler (regular size) came on an ice sculpture made out of crushed ice (like the stuff a snow-cone is made out of), with a flashing-multicolored light at the bottom of the ice. Very cool presentation that I haven't seen before.

Very polite and attentive all Asian staff. Glasses were refilled quickly.

Prices are in line with other high-quality Japanese/sushi places.

The end of another satisfying meal is met with the pleasant,simple presentation of after dinner orange slices.

Sharing four rolls was the way to go.  Could I have eaten more...yeah I probably could have eaten 14 more rolls.  But after four I feel good and guilt free.

I keep finding these crunchy rice crispy bits in my sushi.  I've never had anything like this...airy and delightful taking the food to another level.

The Volcano roll is one of my favorites and is often key to how I judge my sushi bar.  Tomo does it like no other.  It looks like someone just dumped  2 quarts of this orange crab concoction onto some circularly arranged rolls.  Hell yes!  

Our sushi is presented on a simple white plate except for the Volcano roll which comes on its own flame engulfed plate with Japanese curse words written on the plate with saracha.  

The miso is great here.  It's so salty I can feel my fingers swelling as finish the last bits of tofu.  The salad that comes with meal is iceberg lettuce with a ginger dressing.  And Im okay with that......every meal doesn't have to be micro-greens.  Iceberg lettuce has a time and place.  Plus with the polar ice caps melting its gonna get harder and harder to find.  So eat up.

Our waitress is super bummed out.  She got dumped.  Or just got her first Morrisey CD.  Or hates her job.  I don't really care.  I'm not here for fake smiles.  Just bring the food and the check in a timely manner and you will get 20% guaranteed.

There is a lot of variety out there and maybe you like the freshest sashimi and someone else likes rolls so deep fried and covered in sauces that it tastes more like the state fair than sushi. Whatever floats your boat. I've tried a lot of sushi in Indianapolis and Tomo is my favorite place. I'm not claiming it's the best (which would be unfair, given that I haven't tried all the places in town) or the most authentic (I've never been to Japan). But for me, it's the best. 

Let's start with the atmosphere. I think it's fine. It's dark, the tables are comfortable and appropriately spaced apart from each other so you don't have to hear your neighbor slurping their udon. I would not be mad if someone took me there on a first date but it's not so fancy that I feel weird rolling in wearing yoga pants. 

The staff have always been friendly and attentive. There was a time when we came in regularly and they remembered and greeted us with smiles all around. The glasses never got too empty which is very important when you're downing spicy tuna rolls.

For me, Tomo earns its place as my favorite for the value. The rolls are huge and priced lower than many other places. At lunch, you can get your choice of two rolls served with either soup, salad, or soda for $7.75. After tax and tip it's still cheaper than the grocery store with the added bonus of not eating grocery store sushi. The tuna/avocado and salmon/avocado rolls I had today were massive.

He does all the cool, flashy knife tricks, but what really sets him apart and makes him great is that he's actually got a personality.  He's funny and makes the meal an experience.

Right Daddy? Because I really like it here!"" Out of the mouths of babes, need I say more! After receiving a note from a fellow yelper on my review of Tegry ( which I have always held in high regard) saying that he enjoyed Tegry but his heart remained with Tomo, I felt compelled to try it. Now, I've driven by Tomo several hundred times I've been to Capri, only God knows how many times, I've been in that plaza at radio shack, game stop, the pet store and Walmart an uncountable number of times. I've contemplated lunch....maybe dinner..??.. At Tomo probably 2 dozen times and have been weary about trying it. When it comes to sushi, I've been eating it for 35 years, have eaten it all over the country and out of the country and nothing is worse than bad sushi so I was weary!! To say the least. I thank my fellow Yelper for energizing me with the courage to venture into the unknown rather than stick with the comfort of the past. Tonight was the night. I only had 2 of my children my youngest 8 year old Brooke, who would eat anything I tell her is good or I tell her is a baby anything. Hi Brookie daddy says eat this it's a baby tarantula... Okay daddy, mmmmm that's good!! LOL and my oldest Robert 13 7/8 years old who, I must say was much more adventurous in his earlier years but can still put a ""hurtin"" on some sushi. The decor was cool like a mix between Miyagi and the 96th street Naked Tchopstix.  We ordered Tako Su, keystone Roll, Lobster tempura roll ( best I've ever had), Rock & Roll, tuna sashimi, scallop sashimi, ama Ebi with the fried heads! The presentation was nothing less than flawless and believe you me I'm not a huge presentation guy as long as it is good but these rolls were works of art and they tasted as good as if not better than they look.

I'd also read numerous positive reviews about their excellent lunch pricing.  I can tell you that the sushi was fresh, tasty and well-prepared. (However, it could have just a bit more flavor overall, perhaps with the vegetables in their rolls.)  I can also confirm that the sushi served at lunchtime was indeed a great value, as my drink and salad were both included in the 3-roll meal.  All of this for around 10 bucks, and you're able to watch the sushi chef make your lunch while sitting in the front dining room.

Also I confirm that the entire staff is Japanese and they dress in formal serving attire (black & white).  I like that formality, because the restaurant is semi-formal, dark and elegant, which was somewhat a pleasant surprise given their excellent lunch pricing.  It is extremely clean as one might expect.  I believe it has some nice dark booths on the other side of the dining room, so would be nice for a romantic dinner as well.  I will be going back to Tomo the next time I'm in Indy.  I'm definitely a fan of this fine sushi restaurant!

For lunch, any 2 rolls for $7.25, any 3 rolls for $10.25. Soup, salad, or soft drink included.

We started off with Pork Gyoza as an app. Though tasty, the dumplings were just barely warm. Not sure if they sat too long, or if they were never properly cooked to begin with. We both chose soup as our accompaniment, and again, it was hardly warm. Great flavor, but not hot like soup should be. 

For our rolls, I had the Spicy Tuna and Philly Roll, and my friend ordered the Salmon Avocado and Tuna Avocado Roll. Among the four, the Spicy Tuna absolutely stood out. It was zippy and fresh. Highly recommend it. There was no way either of us could have eaten 3 of Tomo's sushi rolls as they are so large...but don't let that stop you! Order away -- the sushi is excellent.

A note on the service: my friend was just eating his ginger (literally his fork was in his hand) when a serer who was not our own approached the table and took his plate without warning. I had ginger to share but an awkward moment, still.

I have lived in the Clearwater neighborhood there for ten or so years now and have been eating in Tomo off and on for much of that time, sometimes by myself and sometimes with a friend. I have always found it to be a delightful dining experience.

There is convenient free off-street parking in a private lot directly in front of the establishment. Inside, the public area provides seating for approximately eighty patrons and is divided primarily into two spaces, one concentrating on hibachi and one on less interactive dining. The overall area is clean and tidy, the lighting is dim, and quiet Asian music plays in the background. Japanese decor is displayed throughout.

In my experience the wait staff has invariably been attentive, cordial, informative, and professional.

The menu includes soups; salads; small plate starters; sushi entrees; a range of donburi, hibachi, katsu, tempura, and teriyaki dinners; noodles and rice dinners; à la carte sashimi and sushi selections; a children's section; and more. They also have a full bar. The prices are all reasonable.

On my most recent visit just this past week I ordered a Vodka cocktail; a Steak Teriyaki Dinner (which was served sizzling hot) with veggies and rice; and à la carte Octopus, Shrimp, and Yellowtail sashima. It was, as always, all delightful.

I asked for noodles instead since I did not like the yum yum fried rice and returned the rice. They charged my extra for the noodles. Then when we went to pay, everyone's card got declined because they don't know how to work a credit card machine. We all have the chip, and they were not leaving the chip in long enough.

Best sushi I have had in Indy and probably anywhere.  The sashimi is high quality, fresh, crisp cuts, absolutely delish.  But the ROLLS - oh my.  They really are some of the best my mouth has had the pleasure of exploring.  Could it be because they use limited amounts of rice?  have quality fish?  Use the right combination of perfectly paired fresh ingredients?  The presentation?  or is it all about those SAUCES?  yumME!  By far the Spicy Girl roll is my favorite.  Spicy tuna in the middle with fresh made spicy tuna on top.  Since it's made fresh to order the little tempura chips are still crunchy - it's absolutely bliss.

We have been going to Tomo for about 2 years now but since we moved out east we only make it out there every other month or so and every time we leave we say ""why don't we just make the drive here more often?  It's so worth it!""

Sushi is the best I've had in indy in terms of freshness and roll quality. They don't offer a lot of crazy flavor combinations like you'd find at h20 (now closed) or at the swanky places downtown but they do offer a few custom specials and every single roll I've seen consistently on other menus (like a dragon roll or spicy tuna roll)

Our servers have always been friendly and prompt but not overbearing or anything.

The environment inside the place is a little outdated. It's a weird mix of like...ocean themed stuff and then also a fancy restaurant. It's a little weird but everything is clean and in good repair and it's never loud or bright in there so it'd be a great place to take a date.

Their clear soup is delicious and their house salad is simple and refreshing. The staff is always friendly and people are always coming by to refresh your drink. 

To the eats: One of my stand-by rolls is the Spicy Girl roll. It is so delicious, with spicy salmon on the inside and spicy tuna mix with crunchy bits on the top. The thing that makes Tomo's sushi so delicious is the plating with the 4 sauces. They pretty much enhance any roll you order. We have tried most of the ""special"" rolls menu, and alongside the Spicy Girl, the Tomo Special Roll and Keystone Roll are favorites. I prefer to order a side of sashimi on the side, and their salmon sashimi is always fresh, ice cold, and delicious. Seems simple, but it can be easy to mess up sashimi. If you are looking for a smaller roller, I suggest the yellowtail scallion roll or the spicy scallop roll. Both are great.

As for hibachi, their prices are great compared to other places and you get a heaping plate of food that almost always winds up in a ""To Go"" box. I have ordered the shrimp, chicken, steak, and scallops. None of them disappointed. Their fried rice is some of the best I've had. It is full of flavor and absolutely delicious. Their lunch hibachi specials are extremely affordable.

Tomo seems to fly a bit under the radar in its strip mall location in front of Walmart, but don't let that deter you. It's much bigger inside than I expected.

There's a pretty extensive menu here, and I really enjoyed my deep-fried spicy tuna ""Keystone"" rolls. Also sampled some of the hibachi fare, and found the steak, fried rice and veg very good. Ditto the pork gyoza and the edamame. My son is a HUGE fan of the soup and happy to visit just for that alone.

For lunch, $11.95 can get me 3 rolls + a nice size side salad. I got the spicy yellowtail, tuna avocado, and eel tempura roll. They sure are generous with the fish and it tastes fresh like the sea, not the sewage they feed you at cheapo-buffets. It'd be perfect if they had a low-sodium soy sauce, since the regular one they have is quite salty.

Next time, I'll get 2 rolls instead. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach since I walked in hungry. I don't want to walk out looking like I have a preggo belly after that rice swells and fills me up.

Despite having never been there myself, I went in and purchased the gift certificate and found myself impressed by the friendliness and atmosphere. 

Flash forward to last night when I met fellow Yelpers Rick G. and Holly G. for dinner after what had been a mentally draining day for all of us due to different reasons. We wanted to hang out together, enjoy a good meal, soak in a decent atmosphere and not have to be ""on."" 

Mission accomplished. 

I'm not a sushi guy and I can even say that Japanese is not really my favorite type of cuisine. However, I don't ""dislike"" it and occasionally find that it really hits the spot. I arrived last night at the strip center spot it's located at - a former Discount Video in an area that is kind of hit-and-miss. I already knew that their curb cut at the end of the sidewalk closest to Tomo isn't even close to ADA compliant. It's a steep grade and if you have any upper body issues, there's no way you'll make it up it. I'm fairly decent in terms of upper body strength and even I have to get a bit of a good start to make it up without wheeling backward. 

Once you go in, you have a small entry way and then an entrance that leads to a Hibachi area to the left and a traditional dining room on the right. Tomo also recently started offering online ordering via their website and they also offer delivery. 

Due to a delay at their homestead, Rick and Holly arrived a bit late and after waiting in my car for a few minutes I decided to go ahead and hang out inside. You really get a sense of the ambience as it gets dark outside - the restaurant is dimly lit and the hibachi area was quite lively last night. One table, in particular, seemed to be having way too much fun and I was way impressed with one area that had the flames really going higher than I've seen for hibachi. It was fun to watch even though we were in the more traditional dining room. 

We sat at a 4-top. The server was friendly and attentive. I'd had my first iced tea refill even before Rick and Holly arrived, while I perused the menu. Rick had recent posted a photo of their Katsu Don, a ""breaded pork or chicken cutlet deep-fried onion carrot & egg over rice."" After considering a Teriyaki dish, I went with the Katsu Don and chose pork over chicken. The arriving dish was far more substantial and looked somewhat different than I'd seen in Rick's photo, though we all agreed it was likely the difference between a lunch special and dinner. This was Rick and Holly's first time being there for dinner. 

The food was quite good - I would likely order it again, though I will confess that Rick's dish looked even better and I think I might experiment a bit. My dish was definitely more than I could eat - somewhat rare for me, and I ended up bring some home. 

This was the definitive 4-star experience for me. The food was very good, the atmosphere quite enjoyable (and way better than you'd expect looking at the strip center), and the service was top notch. The prices are definitely higher for dinner - Rick and Holly ended up surprising me by picking up the bill (""We have a coupon!""), but they seemed to be happy with the value. 

Overall, I wouldn't say Tomo will be a regular spot for me but it's definitely a place I won't hesitate to return to and I wouldn't be surprised if it ends up on my ""once in a while"" rotation. I will also note that they have lunch specials that are incredibly affordable if you want to give them a try and have a lesser commitment.",11/21/2018 11:59

We picked this place for mulitple reasons: because I love sushi; they also have habachi for those people who don't like sushi; and I had never been there (I'm all about a new place). So four to five of us are there at first. We tried to explain that we wanted to be seated, and that more people would be coming later. OMG.

sushi, and some wanted habachi. They kept telling us that they could only seat two or more people for the habachi. For the love, people. We seriously had to explain this to three people.

Portions are huge, and come with soup and salad. Bring your appetite. Recommend having this be your only ddestinatoon of the night because you will leave smelling heavily of the food...seriously I can always smell it in my hair after. Tomo has a yelp  check in promo  which was a nice bonus and surprise. 

I have never had a long wait, they do a great job of turning over tables and trying to get you seated. Overall fun experience for a once in a while meal.",1/24/2020 14:24

I'm not always a fan of the whole Hibachi experience, open flames, oil, my face, hair and overall life at risk...I'll pass. But this time I arrived with friends who were first timers so they wanted the experience. 

Pro-tip: check in so you can get the free Edamame! I knew I wasn't a fan of edamame but they'd never tried it so we checked in and shared it with the family sitting next to us. 

I did order my regular starter the shrimp cucumber roll add avocado with a side of eel sauce. Which was absolutely amazing so amazing in fact that I did not share with said friends who were present at the table. Just silently sat there annihilating my sushi roll. I did switch up my entree order and tried their Pad Thai which was absolutely fantastic and shared amongst friends (I have some humanity and this was way too good to not spread the wealth)! It was sweet and salty and just overall a piping hot dish of deliciousness! It such a large helping that I had plenty of leftovers that I took home with me and my Wife ate it ALL in the night! #Marriage am I right or am I right? But the good news for you dear reader is that she also loved it so you have 2 thumbs up from us!",10/19/2018 12:47
999,tURNOgXdJNRD2meynLZYrQ,yTBVMtZfLxQ1TE7ZIiRCFw,Dtuf4vD0znzwJW9vk3iTNw,4,0,0,0,Tomo is not an authentic Japanese restaurant but it stays true to the Japanese steakhouse motif. Tomo is great for dinner but their lunch menu leaves a lot to be desired. The dinner Teppanyaki is wonderful with the shrimp being the best part. It's much better than Benihana. The lunch portions are smaller and lack the sizzle present in the dinner food.,12/31/2011 19:03
1000,tCAV0QSaXdCx6yEli6wr3Q,L6Zqo6QlmR3wMpf7pbQEWA,Dtuf4vD0znzwJW9vk3iTNw,1,0,0,0,They are so rude on the phone sounds like I am forcing them to make reservation she didn't even say thank you or have a good day,4/10/2021 17:55
