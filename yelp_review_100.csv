She did not apologize for me not being acknowledged, but told me there was a problem with the gas in the restaurant and they could not prepare and serve food in a timely manner.

This can only help them because there were people that did not even know that there was a B&N on the other side of the bridge and shopped here all the time.  Bad news for the little shops over on the other side, though.  However, if the River's Edge development is any indication, the right mix of national and local tenants, along with a pricy facelift, will bring back the old B&N strip.

Now to the new B&N!  It's clean, bright and organized.  It's also very roomy.  Not overcrowded like some bookstores are.  Maybe because they don't have much of a music selection (at least I did not see one) and that helped bring about space.  One thing that WILL keep them in business is the brilliant kids section.  It takes up the back third of the store!  It is so vibrant with colors and layout that it will definitely help kids start or continue their love of reading... and lead to future adult customers, who will be most likely buying their Nooks from here.

Just like many other BN stores, it sells overpriced books (few sales and few coupons) and CDs/DVDs. You can also pay the overpriced BN member rewards card ($25 a year) with little benefits ( -- 10% extra discount for members and some coupons sent via e-mail).  The store has a coffee shop that serves Starbucks coffee, pastries and sandwiches. Nice coffee shop. Great sugar cookies!!! Yum.

Here are my issues with this particular store:  

1) The space is limited and crowded. It has very limited seating in the books area. You have to bring the books to the coffee shop area if you need to read. I usually go there when I have specific things I'd like to buy, check their website first if they have the items ""in-stock"" and leave when I am done.

2) The children section is not great either, small area, no place to sit, too many dolls, toys and knick knacks that distract the children from getting the books.

3)  Cold staff - except for few people who work in the Children area, I have never had any one who is friendly. They need to smile... 

Despite all of the negatives, I think this particular BN store is doing a great job in fulfilling their social responsibility. BN has provided a space for area schools to have their Annual Bookfair for fundraising and Art Fair. In addition, they also offer 30% discount for teachers.",8/31/2010 14:50

There is a Starbucks here, of course. (Do they even allow Barnes & Nobles to exists without coffee shops anymore -- I mean, really?)

Yes, prices are higher than used bookstores, but that's how it's always been. B&N always has great sales once or twice a month and has a huge clearance selection, so if you disagree with the price of a brand new hardback, either wait for the paperback or come back for a sale. Or, better yet, become a member and get ridiculous discounts on everything.

I come here all the time, and went to the store before it moved, and I've always had a great experience. The store is well organized (and ACTUALLY in alphabetical order) and now that they've moved, it's humongous. No more awkward aisle shuffling when someone else wants the same book as you. They don't mind if you sit and read for a bit, and the cafe is quick and friendly. Tech support for Nooks users is always available and they seem like they know what they're talking about. Now that I have a niece, I actually visit the children's section and appreciate that it's never a jumbled, grimy mess. They have everything labelled by age group to make it easy. 

As for the staff, they are always available and friendly and know their stuff. If I mention an author, odds are they know who it is and where to find it. If they don't have what you need in store, they jump at the chance to order it to be delivered to their store. The only reason I don't give this place five stars is because they suffer from the perpetual understaffed checkout line that many large retailers are afflicted with. I wouldn't blame customer service on that--I'd blame the chain.

Too bad the customer service is TERRIBLE.

I was extremely disappointed with the service that I received from my local store on 82nd street here in Indianapolis.  I had an issue with my one month old Nook Simple Touch with Glowlight.  I figured that it would be best to take it in to the local store, right?  WRONG!  The Nook rep there was not helpful and rude.  She basically told me that I must have done something to scratch my Nook, that it was my fault, and that she could not help me.  She admitted that she had never seen my issue before, but refused to do anything to help at all.  When I got home (obviously I was upset - I had only had my Nook for a month, and I was upset that B&N was not going to stand behind their product), I Googled my issue, and what do you know - it is a very common issue, a known problem with my particular Nook.  I called the local store again - once again got terrible customer service - asked to speak to the manager, who apparently was not available.  I asked for the manager to return my call - the rep on the line did not even ask for my name.  I asked who would be returning my call - ""Jeff.""  Jeff who? I asked - ""Jeff Peckman"".  Do you think that Jeff Peckman returned my call?  NOPE.  Terrible service - I will not be shopping at that store ever again.  It should not be too much to ask that B&N staffs their stores with people who actually know a few things about the product.  At least a little common courtesy?",6/19/2013 18:10

I do prefer small bookstores usually, but Barnes & Noble was so convenient and the only other bookstore in the area didn't have what I wanted.

As more readers grab books online, the need for giant bookstores might become a convenience rather than a primary source.  

So this chain has added lots of departments that aren't too far of a stretch from reading to appeal to customers and continue to bring them in.  Besides thousands of books, there was an artists supplies area, a video area, a toys and games area, periodicals, young readers, and a cafe!  Throw in convenient parking (free) out front and you could spend a lot of free time browsing the store, finding something of interest, and then grabbing something in the cafe so you don't have to wait to start reading!

Well kept and plenty of staff even on a Monday evening to assist customers find what they wanted.

They have cut down their music and DVD section significantly, but you should still be able to find new releases. I like shopping on the website for either items I can't find in the store or if I just want to order material on line for a quick store pick up.

For the price and especially the big portions it is simply amazing . Me and my husband use to enjoys Benihana's but I think we like hibachi express better . The portions are huge and it is filled with tons of meat . I got the chicken steak and shrimp hibachi with a side of broccoli , it literally took me three days to eat it . The homemade yum yum side is too die for . We got a big side sauce so we can enjoy it at home also . My husband got the special fried rice filled with chicken steak and shrimp . He loved it he loves fried rice and he said it was one of the best fried rice with meat and vegetables that he has ever had , they only complaint he had was that he could have ordered more vegetables in his rice like a broccoli or more mushrooms .

Diamond Virgin Hair Company is unprofessional and rude. I have never experienced such callous disregard from any well-known company. Mayven and HerImports are accessible and communicative with me. Even Aliexpress has excellent follow-up. The Diamond Virgin Hair Company team runs away and hides when a critique is made. Their product is not perfect. They are selling hair that is grown from other human beings. It will never be perfect, and some customers will have varying experiences while wearing your product. That should be expected, and there should be a plan in place to deal with such occurrences. The hair that I received sheds A LOT. The wefts are intact, the hair was not bleached, and it has been routinely cowashed. I have been experiencing this problem from day one. I reached out to them, and they never responded. 

Diamond Virgin Hair Company's lack of communication speaks volumes about the sustainability of this company. However, you all cannot negate the concerns of customers after accepting payment. They have no right to treat customers in this manner, and they cannot continue this practice. This behavior is why Diamond Hair Company is not number #1, and it must be corrected if they ever wish to be. 

The BBB must investigate these types of companies. Diamond Virgin Hair Company pays reviewers of social media to lure unsuspecting customers to their website. This company communicated with me about purchasing hair, but when the conversation became an inquiry about the quality of the hair that I received, the communicated ceased. There was no follow-up for over one year; that is customer abandonment. These practices need to be investigated and stopped. U.S. businesses must continue to uphold a certain standard.",5/11/2018 18:18

Another issue with them is that, their timing between the order and it being shipped is ""CRAZY"". All three times I have ordered from them, I had to call them about my order.

It continues to shed and tangle. This is not expected when purchasing a quality unit as advertise. For this wig to be close to 400 dollars; it has the quality of a beauty supply wig. It continues to shed and tangle and it's starting to thin. I am very unhappy. Spending close to 400 dollars for a wig I wouldn't expect this. I've reached out to the company and was advised of their 5 day return policy and they are unable to do anything about it. But offers me products on their website to help with shedding and tangling. It took me about a months to receive the wig and I already had a protective hair style before I was able to apply the wig for the first time . Two weeks later I wore the wig for the first time and the first day it  Shedded  and tangled with no added product. The wig was not manipulated the first wear. I manipulated the wig after I noticed it was thicker at the roots and thin(Almost see through at the ends). I simply plucked the part lightly and mold the hair with setting lotion this didn't help at all.

I simply will not purchase products for Diamond hair company again. I wish they inspect  their  product better and ensure their customers are TRUELY getting quality product.

I had been asked by a few friends to try Diamond's Hair and let them know my experience.  It was absolutely the worst business transaction I have dealt with in a very long time.  Diamond accepted my payment and then gave me the run around about the status of my shipment for over a week.  I was told it would be shipped out on 3 occasions and it never was.  After I had enough I demanded a refund.  Magically, my hair was available that day and I could pick up (even though I had paid $13 for express shipping).   I needed the hair same day so I obliged.   As  if things couldn't get worse I drove 45 minutes to pick up the hair and they told me they had ""accidentally"" shipped it!!!!        And if that doesn't take the cake they sent me an email the next morning stating that they had shipped my product three days prior, which was an outright lie! 

I understand people make mistakes but the company was unprofessional  and they had to lie to boot.   The establishment looks great but they are VERY tacky when conducting business.  A GOOD company would have at the very least offered an accommodation or partial refund for their royal screw ups.  Then I may have actually come back.  I will be putting in a complaint to the Better Business Bureau, as this is unacceptable and apparently I wont be the first to do so.
