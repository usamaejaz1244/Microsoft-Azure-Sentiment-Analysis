I don't go to Denny's often but I didn't remember the food being that bad, completely unsatisfactory. We only got 3 menus, the waitress only come to our table for drinks, order, food, check. We ran out of drinks and never got a refill of all you can eat pancakes. The ranch tasted like sour milk, I can make better pancakes with a box of ""just add water"" mix. Waste of 40$ for the four of us.",5/8/2016 8:49

I came in at about 6:20 AM for a cup of coffee and a quiet place to study before an oil change.  Although the hostess station had a sign stating that I needed to wait to be seated, no one acknowledged me.  After 2 minutes of standing there, I called ""Hello?"" audibly into the kitchen and still was not acknowledged.  I finally stood at the hostess station and called the restaurant from my cell phone in an attempt to be acknowledged.  The phone rang loudly into the restaurant for another 3-4 minutes with no acknowledgement.  I finally walked around the restaurant trying to find staff to acknowledge me and found a waitress.  She did not apologize for me not being acknowledged, but told me there was a problem with the gas in the restaurant and they could not prepare and serve food in a timely manner.  Needless to say, I didn't waste any more time here and went to a competitor.  I would recommend you don't waste your time here either.",8/30/2017 10:52

The waitstaff was fast with the refills and great with the kids. The food was what you exspect at a Dennys and the place was clean.,3/16/2014 13:59

French fries were room temperature and already salt with to much salt. Don't order from there if you're looking for a regular hamburger and fries they can't handle it!!!,8/12/2018 15:32

I showed the waitress and she apologized, but clearly it wasn't her fault.
I would think the cooks would wear hair nets! Hello health department!",3/30/2018 14:49
